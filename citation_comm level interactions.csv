The study employed a quasi‐experimental non‐equivalent control group design to compare intervention participants (n = 598) with people participating in unrelated programs in distinct but similar geographical areas (control, n = 301). We conducted participant interviews at baseline, 18‐, and 36‐months on HIV vulnerability and related health outcomes, food security, and economic vulnerability. Randomly selected households (n = 1002) were interviewed in the intervention and control areas at baseline and 36 months. Compared to the control group, the intervention led to increased HIV testing (OR 1.90; 95 % CI 1.29‐2.78) and HIV case finding (OR = 2.13; 95 % CI 1.07‐4.22); decreased food insecurity (OR = 0.74; 95 % CI 0.63‐0.87), increased nutritional diversity, and improved economic resilience to shocks. Most effects were sustained over a 3‐year period. Further, no significant differences in change were found over the 3‐year study period on surveys of randomly selected households in the intervention and control areas. Although there were general trends toward improvement in the study area, only intervention participants' outcomes were significantly better. Results indicate the intervention can improve economic and food security and HIV vulnerability through increased testing and case finding. Leveraging the resources of economic development NGOs to deliver locally‐developed programs with scientific funding to conduct controlled evaluations has the potential to accelerate the scientific evidence base for the effects of economic development programs on health.","21","3","712‐723","Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL)","PUBMED 27350305","EMBASE 619838145",,,,"Journal article","*Developing Countries; *Models, Economic; *Outcome Assessment, Health Care; *Rural Population; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Agriculture [economics]; Economics; Female; Food Supply [*economics]; HIV Infections [*economics, *prevention & control, transmission]; Health Plan Implementation [economics, organization & administration]; Health Risk Behaviors; Humans; Malawi; Male; Middle Aged; Non‐Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic; Risk Assessment; Young Adult","10.1007/s10461-016-1455-1","https://www.cochranelibrary.com/central/doi/10.1002/central/CN-01603058/full","Public Health"

Enhanced homestead food production (EHFP) and aquaculture, which increase availability of nutrient‐dense foods, are promising interventions to improve dietary intake. This study examined the effect of EHFP with or without aquaculture on dietary intake and prevalence of inadequate intake of select nutrients among women and children living in rural Cambodia, compared to controls. In a registered, cluster randomized controlled trial in Prey Veng, Cambodia, 10 households in each of 90 villages (n = 900) were randomized by village to receive EHFP, EHFP plus aquaculture, or control. After 22‐month intervention, 24‐hr dietary recalls (24HRs) were collected from mothers aged 18‐50 years (n = 429) and their children aged 6 months‐7 years (n = 421), reported by their mothers. Usual intake distributions (generated using 24HRs and repeat 24HRs on a subsample) were used to estimate prevalence of inadequate intake. Compared to controls, women in the EHFP group had significantly higher zinc (+1.0 mg/d) and Vitamin A (+139 retinol activity equivalents/d) intakes, and women in the EHFP plus aquaculture group had significantly higher iron (+2.7 mg/d), Vitamin A (+191 retinol activity equivalents/d), and riboflavin (+0.17 mg/d) intakes. Women in the EHFP plus aquaculture group also had significantly lower prevalence of inadequate iron (‐7%, at 10% bioavailability), Vitamin A (‐19%), and riboflavin (‐17%) intakes, compared to controls. No significant differences in intakes or nutrient adequacy were observed among children or between EHFP and EHFP plus aquaculture groups. The biological importance of the small differences in nutrient intakes among women remains to be established.","14","3","e12581","Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL)","PUBMED 29314705",,,,,"Journal article","Adolescent; Adult; Aquaculture; Body Mass Index; Cambodia [epidemiology]; Child; Child, Preschool; Cluster Analysis; Diet; Family Characteristics; Female; Humans; Infant; Male; Malnutrition [*epidemiology]; Micronutrients [administration & dosage, deficiency]; Middle Aged; Nutrition Assessment; Nutritional Requirements; Riboflavin Deficiency [*epidemiology]; Riboflavin [administration & dosage]; Rural Population; Surveys and Questionnaires; Vitamin A Deficiency [*epidemiology]; Vitamin A [administration & dosage]; Young Adult; Zinc [administration & dosage]","10.1111/mcn.12581","https://www.cochranelibrary.com/central/doi/10.1002/central/CN-01944505/full","Public Health"

The primary aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of a nutrition‐sensitive enhanced homestead food production (EHFP) programme on anaemia in women (18–45 years) and children (6–59 months) in rural Cambodia. Secondary outcomes were women's micronutrient status and women and children's anthropometry. In this cluster‐randomized controlled trial, 900 households from 90 villages (clusters) were randomized to either (a) home gardens and behaviour change communication (BCC) on nutrition, hygiene, women's empowerment, and marketing (EHFP); (b) home gardens plus fishponds and BCC (EHFP + F); or (c) control (no intervention). Haemoglobin concentration and anthropometry were measured in women and children at baseline and at 22 months. Venous blood samples were collected in a subset of women (n = 450) at baseline and at 22 months. Generalized linear mixed effect models with repeated measures were used to evaluate the difference across groups and the change from baseline to end of study. Ninety clusters, 552 women, and 754 children completed the trial. Compared with control, we found a statistically significant impact on anaemia prevalence in children (−14.0 percentage points; P = 0.02) and retinol binding protein concentrations in women (difference in difference: 0.34; P = 0.02) randomized to EHFP and EHFP + F groups, respectively. No other statistically significant effects on anaemia, nutritional biomarker concentrations, or anthropometry were observed. Future research is needed to examine longer term impacts of EHFP on anthropometry in women and children and into the nutritional causes of anaemia among children in Cambodia.","15 Suppl 3","Suppl 3","e12757","Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL)","PUBMED 31148398","EMBASE 627942117","","","","Journal article","*anemia; *enhanced homestead food production; *food industry; Adolescent; Adult; Age distribution; Anemia [*diet therapy, *prevention & control]; Anthropometry; Aquaculture; Article; Behavior change; Blood sampling; Cambodia [epidemiology]; Cambodian; Child; Child, Preschool; Cluster Analysis; Controlled study; Crops, Agricultural; Diet [*classification]; Female; Follow up; Gardening; Health Behavior; Human; Humans; Hygiene [education]; Infant; Infant Nutritional Physiological Phenomena; Major clinical study; Male; Maternal Nutritional Physiological Phenomena; Micronutrients [*administration & dosage, deficiency]; Middle Aged; Nutritional Status; Nutritional status; Outcome assessment; Prevalence; Priority journal; Randomized controlled trial; Rural Population; Rural area; Young Adult","10.1111/mcn.12757","https://www.cochranelibrary.com/central/doi/10.1002/central/CN-01956647/full","Public Health"

Cash transfers, as part of safety net approach, have potential to prevent under‐nutrition. However, most of the cash transfer programs implemented and scientifically evaluated do not have a clear nutritional objective, which leads to a lack of evidence regarding their nutritional benefits. METHODS/DESIGN: The MAM'Out research project aims at evaluating a seasonal and multiannual cash transfer program to prevent acute malnutrition in children under 36 months, in terms of effectiveness and cost‐effectiveness in the Tapoa province (Eastern region of Burkina Faso, Africa). The program is targeted to economically vulnerable households with children less than 1 year old at the time of inclusion. Cash is distributed to mothers and the transfers are unconditional, leading to beneficiaries' self‐determination on the use of cash. The study is designed as a two‐arm cluster randomized intervention trial, based on the randomization of rural villages. One group receives cash transfers via mobile phones and one is a control group. The main outcomes are the cumulative incidence of acute malnutrition and the cost‐effectiveness. Child anthropometry (height, weight and MUAC) is followed, as well as indicators related to dietary diversity, food security, health center utilization, families' expenses, women empowerment and morbidities. 24 h‐food recalls are also carried out. Individual interviews and focus group discussions allow collecting qualitative data. Finally, based on a theory framework built a priori, the pathways used by the cash to have an effect on the prevention of under‐nutrition will be assessed. DISCUSSION: The design chosen will lead to a robust assessment of the effectiveness of the proposed intervention. Several challenges appeared while implementing the study and discrepancies with the research protocol, mainly due to unforeseen events, can be highlighted, such as delay in project implementation, switch to e‐data collection and implementation of a supervision process.

Following a needs assessment, unconditional seasonal, multiannual cash transfers were implemented as a safety net to prevent childhood undernutrition. The objectives of this study were to explore the types of purchases made by beneficiaries of this cash transfer program and to understand the perceived effects of and changes induced by regular cash transfers in the daily lives of women, and at the household and community level. METHODS: The design of this study was a two‐arm cluster randomized controlled trial. Qualitative data were collected each month during the cash transfer period for two years, leading to a total of more than 300 interviews and focus group discussions with various participants: beneficiary mothers, heads of households, mothers‐in‐law, co‐wives, key members of the community, and participants of the control group. RESULTS: The two main types of expenses reported were food and health care for the child and the whole family. The program was also associated with positive perceived changes at the household level, mainly related to gender equality and improvement of women's status, and has promoted an increase in dignity and social integration of the poorest at the community level through cash sharing. Unexpected effects of this program included some women planning new pregnancies and some individuals not expecting the transfers to end. CONCLUSION: Although the transfers were unconditional, the cash was mainly used to improve the children's and households' food security and health, which correspond to two main underlying causes of undernutrition. Therefore, spending mainly in these areas can help to prevent undernutrition in children.

However, quantitative data on the impact of cash transfer programs on children's energy and nutrient intakes are lacking.Objective: The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of seasonal unconditional cash transfers on children's energy, micro‐ and macronutrient, and food group intakes during the lean season in Burkina Faso.Methods: Within the framework of the MAM'Out (Moderate Acute Malnutrition Out) cluster‐randomized controlled trial, two 24‐h dietary recall surveys were conducted in July and August 2014. Daily energy and macro‐ and micronutrient intakes, breastfeeding practices, and food group consumption were analyzed for 322 children aged 14‐27 mo from an intervention group (benefiting from unconditional cash transfer during the lean season in 2013 and 2014) and a control group by using mixed linear, logistic, and Poisson regression models or a γ‐generalized linear model with log‐link. A dietary diversity score was calculated on the basis of 7 food groups.Results: Unconditional cash transfers during the lean season improved the diets of rural children through a higher consumption of eggs (11.3 ± 1.55 compared with 3.25 ± 0.79 g; P < 0.001), fat (20.6 ± 0.80 compared with 16.5 ± 0.89 g; P < 0.01), and vitamin B‐12 (0.40 ± 0.02 compared with 0.34 ± 0.02 mg; P < 0.001) compared with controls and higher proportions of children consuming dairy products (OR: 4.14; 95% CI: 1.48, 11.6; P < 0.05), flesh foods (OR: 2.09; 95% CI: 1.18, 3.70; P < 0.05), and iron‐rich or iron‐fortified foods (OR: 2.23; 95% CI: 1.20, 4.13; P < 0.05). No difference was found in energy intake between the 2 groups. The minimum dietary diversity of two‐thirds of the children who benefited from cash transfers was adequate compared with only one‐third in the control group (P < 0.001).Conclusions: Unconditional seasonal cash transfer increases intakes of high‐nutritional‐value foods in Burkinabe children aged 14‐27 mo. As such, their use can be recommended in actions addressing children's dietary intake during the lean season.

The study population comprised households that were classified as poor or very poor according to household economy approach criteria and that had ≥1 child <1 y of age at inclusion. The intervention consisted of seasonal UCTs, provided monthly from July to November, over 2 y (2013 and 2014). A monthly allowance of 10,000 West African Financial Community of Africa francs (∼US$17) was given by mobile phone to mothers in participating households. Anthropometric measurements and morbidity were recorded on a quarterly basis.Results: We found no evidence that multiannual, seasonal UCTs reduced the cumulative incidence of wasting in young children [incidence rate ratio: 0.92 (95% CI: 0.64, 1.32); P = 0.66]. We observed no significant difference (P > 0.05) in children's anthropometric measurements and stunting between the 2 groups at the end point. However, children in the intervention group had a lower risk [21% (95% CI: 18.6%, 21.3%); P < 0.001] of self‐reported respiratory tract infections than did children in the control group.Conclusions: We found that seasonal UCTs in the framework of safety nets did not result in a significant decrease in the incidence of acute malnutrition among children in Tapoa Province.

They compare the impacts of monthly in‐kind and cash transfers of equivalent value (mean share 11.5 percent of pre‐program consumption) on household welfare as measured by food and total consumption, adult labor supply, and poverty. The results show that approximately two years later the transfer has a large and positive impact on total and food consumption. There are no differences in the size of the effect of transfer in cash versus transfers in‐kind on consumption. The transfer, irrespective of type, does not affect overall participation in labor market activities but induces beneficiary households to switch their labor allocation from agricultural to nonagricultural activities. The analysis finds that the program leads to a significant reduction in poverty. Overall, the findings suggest that the Food Support Program intervention is able to relax the binding liquidity constraints faced by poor agricultural households, and thus increases both equity and efficiency",,,,"Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL)",,,,,,"Journal article",,,"https://www.cochranelibrary.com/central/doi/10.1002/central/CN-00776622/full","Public Health"

To prevent malnutrition, theMexican government implemented the Programa de Apoyo Alimentario (PAL), which transferred either food baskets containing micronutrient‐fortified milk and animal food products or cash to beneficiary families along with educational sessions. Objective: This study evaluated the impact of PAL on 2 indicators of complementary feeding: minimum dietary diversity and consumption of iron‐rich or iron‐fortified foods in children aged 6‐23 mo. Methods: A secondary analysis of the original PAL evaluation design was conducted through a randomized community trial implemented with 3 intervention groups (food basket with education, food basket without education, and cash transfer with education) and a control. The impact of PAL after 14 mo of exposure was estimated in 2 cross‐sectional groups of children aged 6‐23 mo at baseline and at follow‐up in a panel of 145 communities by using difference‐in‐difference models. Only children who lived in households and communities that were similar between treatment groups at baseline were included in the analysis. These children were identified by using a propensity score. Results: Of the 3 intervention groups, when compared with the control, only the food basket without education group component increased the consumption of iron‐rich or iron‐fortified foods by 31.2 percentage points (PP) (P < 0.01) and the prevalence of minimum dietary diversity by 21.6 PP (P < 0.01). Conclusion: These findings suggest that in order to improve dietary quality in children, food baskets that include fortified complementary foods may be more effective than cash transfers. The fact that the 2 food basket groups differed in the observed impact does not allow for more convincing conclusions to be made about the education component of the program.

DESIGN: Interventions involved enrolling three groups of approximately 200 randomly selected households per group in three provinces in Ecuador. Power estimates and sample size were computed using the Optimal Design software, with a power of 80 %, at 5 % of significance and with a minimum detectable effect of 0·25 (sd). The first group was assigned to receive a monthly food voucher of $US 40. The second group was assigned to receive the same $US 40 voucher, plus training on health and nutrition issues. The third group served as the control. Weekly household values of food consumption were converted into energy intake per person per day. A simple proxy indicator was constructed for dietary diversity, based on the Food Consumption Score. Finally, an econometric model with three specifications was used for analysing the differential effect of the interventions. SETTING: Three provinces in Ecuador, two from the Sierra region (Carchi and Chimborazo) and one from the Coastal region (Santa Elena). SUBJECTS: Members of 773 households randomly selected (n 4343). RESULTS: No significant impact on consumption for any of the interventions was found. However, there was evidence that voucher systems had a positive impact on dietary diversity. No differentiated effects were found for the training intervention.

OBJECTIVE: This study tested the effect of an enhanced homestead food production (EHFP) program consisting of home garden, poultry raising, and nutrition education implemented over 2.5 years versus control (no intervention) on anthropometry and anemia among children (12‐48 months) and their mothers. METHODS: An unblinded cluster‐randomized controlled trial involving pre‐ and post‐surveys with independent samples was conducted in rural areas of Baitadi District, Nepal. Data (including weight, height/length, and hemoglobin) were obtained from 2106 and 2614 mother‐child pairs at baseline and follow‐up, respectively. Changes in outcome variables (stunting, underweight, wasting, and anemia among children and underweight and anemia among mothers) were compared between the study groups using mixed‐effects logistic regression models. RESULTS: At follow‐up, anemia was significantly lower among children (odds ratio, OR [95% confidence interval, CI]: 0.76 [0.59‐0.98]) and mothers (OR [95% CI]: 0.62 [0.48‐0.82]) in the treatment group compared to the control. Underweight was lower among mothers in the treatment group compared to the control (OR [95% CI]: 0.61 [0.46‐0.82]). There was no impact on child anthropometry.

OBJECTIVE: This study assessed the impact of Helen Keller International's (HKI) 2‐y integrated agriculture [homestead food production (HFP)] and nutrition and health behavior change communication (BCC) program, targeted to women, on children's (3‐12.9 mo old at baseline) anthropometry (stunting, wasting, and underweight), mean hemoglobin (Hb), anemia (Hb < 11 g/dL), and diarrhea prevalence. METHODS: We used a cluster‐randomized controlled trial, with 55 villages randomly assigned to a control group (n = 25) or 1 of 2 treatment groups (n = 15 each), which differed by who delivered the BCC messages [older women leaders or health committee (HC) members]. We used difference‐in‐difference (DID) estimates to assess impacts on child outcomes. RESULTS: We found marginally significant (P < 0.10) impacts on Hb (DID: 0.51 g/dL; P = 0.07) and wasting [DID: ‐8.8 percentage point (pp); P = 0.08] and statistically significant (P < 0.05) impacts on diarrhea (‐15.9 pp; P = 0.00) in HC compared with control villages among children aged 3‐12.9 mo and larger impacts for anemia (DID: ‐14.6 pp; P = 0.03) and mean Hb (DID: 0.74 g/dL; P = 0.03) among younger children (aged 3‐5.9 mo). However, we found no significant impacts on stunting or underweight prevalence. Plausibility was supported by greater improvements in women's agricultural production and maternal infant and young child feeding and care knowledge and practices in HC compared with control villages. CONCLUSIONS: HKI's 2‐y integrated HFP+BCC program (HC group) significantly improved several child outcomes, including wasting (marginal), diarrhea, Hb, and anemia, especially among the youngest children.

These programs may also improve mothers' nutrition and empowerment outcomes. However, evidence from rigorous evaluations is scarce. OBJECTIVE: We examined impacts of Helen Keller International's 2‐y enhanced‐homestead food production (E‐HFP) program in Burkina Faso on the secondary impact measures of mothers' nutrition and empowerment. METHODS: We used a cluster‐randomized controlled trial whereby 55 villages with 1767 mothers of young children were randomly assigned to 3 groups: 1) control, 2) E‐HFP with the behavior change communication (BCC) strategy implemented by older women leaders, or 3) E‐HFP with BCC implemented by health committee members. Data for the treatment groups were pooled for this analysis because no differences were found between the 2 groups in key mothers' outcomes. We used difference‐in‐differences (DID) estimates to assess impacts on mothers' dietary intake, diversity, body mass index (BMI; in kg/m(2)), prevalence of underweight (BMI <18.5), and empowerment. RESULTS: The E‐HFP program significantly increased mothers' intake of fruit (DID = 15.8 percentage points; P = 0.02) and marginally increased their intake of meat/poultry (DID = 7.5 percentage points; P = 0.08) and dietary diversity (DID = 0.3 points; P = 0.08). The prevalence of underweight was significantly reduced among mothers in treatment compared with control villages by 8.7 percentage points (P < 0.01). Although the changes in BMI did not differ between mothers in treatment and control villages, there was a marginally significant interaction (baseline underweight × change in BMI; P‐interaction = 0.07), indicating that underweight mothers had a greater increase in BMI than did mothers who were not underweight. The E‐HFP program also positively affected mothers' overall empowerment score (DID = 3.13 points out of 37 possible points; P < 0.01) and 3 components of empowerment: meeting with women (DID = 1.21 points out of 5 possible points; P < 0.01), purchasing decisions (DID = 0.86 points out of 8 possible points; P = 0.01), and health care decisions (DID = 0.24 points out of 2 possible points; P = 0.05).

Increased household production increases the availability of own produced food for consumption, as well as income for food purchases. Increased knowledge of nutrition introduced through a behavior change communication strategy can change food preferences and shift purchasing decisions towards nutritious foods. In a randomized control trial, we demonstrate that an integrated agriculture‐nutrition program in Burkina Faso improved the quality of diets by reducing household macro and micronutrient consumption gaps. We estimate production and consumption nutrient gaps for households in our sample by comparing reported consumption or production of nutrients relative to recommended daily allowances for households. Differences between actual nutrient consumption and production values and the recommended daily allowances provide an estimate of the nutrient gaps (surplus or deficit) within the household. We find that the integrated agriculture‐nutrition program reduced consumption nutrient gaps in treatment households. We also investigate whether the production or nutrition knowledge pathways explain the consumption nutrient gap treatment effects. Though crop choice led to a diversified household production of nutritious foods in treatment villages on the extensive production margin, increased household production of nutrients does not explain the improvements in diet quality due to limited treatment effects for the estimated production nutrient gaps at the intensive production margin. Consumption expenditures in treatment villages did increase purchases of nutritious foods, suggesting that the behavior change communication strategy is effective at not only increasing nutrition knowledge, but also in affecting consumer preferences.","101","3","732‐752","Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL)",,,,,,"Journal article",,"10.1093/ajae/aay067","https://www.cochranelibrary.com/central/doi/10.1002/central/CN-02217990/full","Public Health"

Conditional cash transfers are recently established welfare interventions in the region. One, Familias en Accion, transfers ∼20% of average monthly income to women in Colombia's poorest families. Previous work has found that families buy more food as a result. We tested the hypothesis that participation in Familias would be associated with increasing body mass index (BMI) in participating women. METHODS: Women from participating areas and control areas (matched on environmental and socioeconomic criteria) were surveyed in 2002 and 2006. Pregnant, breast‐feeding or women aged <18 or with BMI <18.5 kg m(‐2) were excluded. The sample comprises 835 women from control and 1238 from treatment areas. Because some treatment areas started Familias shortly before baseline data collection, a dummy variable was created that identified exposure independent of time point or area. Follow‐up was 61.5%. BMI was measured by trained personnel using standardized techniques. Overweight was defined as BMI ≥ 25 kg m(‐2) and obesity as ≥ 30 kg m(‐2). The effect of Familias was estimated using linear regression (or logistic regression for dichotomous outcomes) in a double‐difference technique, controlling for several individual, household and area characteristics, including parity and baseline BMI, using robust standard‐errors clustered at area‐level in an intention‐to‐treat analysis. RESULTS: At baseline, women's mean age was 33.3 years and mean BMI 25.3 kg m(‐2); 12.3% women were obese. After adjustment, exposure to Familias was significantly associated with increased BMI (β=0.25; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.03, 0.47; P=0.03). Age (β=0.09; 95% CI 0.06, 0.13; P<0.001) and household wealth (β=0.78; 95% CI 0.41, 1.15; P<0.001) were also positively associated with BMI. Familias was also associated with increased odds of obesity (odds ratio (OR)=1.27; 95% CI 1.03, 1.57; P=0.03), as was age (OR=1.04; 95% CI 1.02, 1.06; P=0.001). CONCLUSION: Conditional cash transfers to poor women in Colombia are independently associated with increasing BMI and obesity risk. Although conditional cash transfers are generally regarded as popular and successful schemes, parallel interventions at individual, household and community level are needed to avoid unanticipated adverse outcomes.","36","9","1209‐1214","Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL)","PUBMED 22143619",,,,,"Journal article","Adult; Cohort Studies; Colombia [epidemiology]; Community Health Services [*statistics & numerical data]; Female; Financing, Government; Government Programs; Health Promotion [economics, methods]; Humans; Obesity [*epidemiology, etiology, prevention & control]; Patient Acceptance of Health Care; Poverty [statistics & numerical data]; Prevalence; Program Evaluation; Prospective Studies; Social Welfare","10.1038/ijo.2011.234","https://www.cochranelibrary.com/central/doi/10.1002/central/CN-01601934/full","Effective Practice and Organisation of Care"

Taking advantage of the two large clustered‐randomized trials in Indonesia from 2007 to 2009, this paper provides evidence on the impact of household cash transfer (PKH) and community cash transfer (Generasi) on child's food consumption. The sample sizes are 14,000 households for PKH and 12,000 households for Generasi. After two years of implementation, difference‐in‐differences (DID) analyses show that both cash transfers lead to significant increases in food consumption particularly for protein‐rich items. The programs significantly increase the consumption of milk and fish by up to 19% and 14% for PKH and Generasi, respectively. Both programs significantly reduce some measures of severe malnutrition. PKH significantly reduces the probability of wasting and severe wasting by 33% and 41% and Generasi significantly reduces the probability of being severely underweight by 47%.

CCT programmes aim to increase human capital investment among poor households in order to break the intergenerational transmission of poverty. Countries in which they are being implemented under the support of the World Bank and other international financial institutions include Mexico, Honduras, Nicaragua, Brazil, Turkey and Mozambique. While the implementation details vary from country to country, many of the programmes are modelled on the Mexican PROGRESA. In the typical CCT, mothers receive cash transfers if their school‐age children attend school and preventive healthcare visits. The targeting of children's health and education is the essence of the long‐term poverty alleviation objective of CCT programmes.

One strategy to fight health inequality due to poverty is conditional cash transfer (CCT). Taking advantage of two large clustered‐randomized trials in indonesia from 2007 to 2009, this paper provides evidence on the effects of household cash transfers (PKH) and community cash transfers (generasi) on determinants of maternal mortality. The sample sizes are 14,000 households for PKH and 12,000 households for generasi. After two years of implementation, difference‐in‐differences (DID) analyses show that the two programs can improve determinants of maternal mortality with generasi provides positive impact in some aspects of determinants, but PKH does not. Generasi improves maternal health knowledge, reduces financial barriers to accessing health services and improves utilization of health services, increases utilization among higher‐risk women, improves posyandu equipment, and increases nutritional intake. AS for PKH, evidence shows its strongest effects only on utilization of health services. Both programs, however, are unlikely to have a large effect on maternal mortality due to design and implementation issues that might significantly reduce program effectiveness. While the programs improved utilization, they did so at community‐based facilities not equipped with emergency obstetric care.

OBJECTIVE: We investigated whether Pantawid improved anthropometric measurements in children aged 6‐36 mo. METHODS: We estimated cross‐sectional intention‐to‐treat effects using a 2011 cluster‐randomized trial across 130 villages‐65 treated and 65 control‐with data collected after 31 mo of implementation. Anthropometry characteristics were measured for 241 children in treated areas and 244 children in control areas. Health service use for children aged 6‐36 mo and dietary intake for those aged 6‐60 mo also were measured. Outcome variables were height‐for‐age z scores (HAZs) and weight‐for‐age z scores (WAZs), stunting, severe stunting, underweight, and severely underweight. Impact also was assessed on perinatal care, institutional delivery, presence of skilled birth attendant, breastfeeding practices, immunization, growth monitoring and deworming, care‐seeking, and children's intake of protein‐rich foods. RESULTS: Pantawid was associated with a significant reduction in severe stunting [<‐3 SD from WHO standards for healthy children; β = ‐10.2 percentage points (95% CI ‐18.8, ‐1.6 percentage points); P = 0.020] as well as a marginally significant increase in HAZs [β = 0.284 SDs (95% CI ‐0.033, 0.602 SDs); P = 0.08]. WAZs, stunting, underweight, and severely underweight status did not change. Concomitantly, several measures of health‐seeking behavior increased significantly. CONCLUSIONS: To our knowledge, Pantawid is one of few CCT programs worldwide that significantly reduced severe stunting in children aged 6‐36 mo; changes in key parenting practices, including children's intake of protein‐rich foods and care���seeking behavior, were concurrent.","146","9","1793‐1800","Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL)","PUBMED 27466610",,,,,"Journal article","Adolescent; Anthropometry; Body Weight; Breast Feeding; Child; Child, Preschool; Cluster Analysis; Cross‐Sectional Studies; Family Characteristics; Growth Disorders [economics, *prevention & control]; Health Behavior; Humans; Infant; Nutritional Status; Philippines [epidemiology]; Prevalence; Public Assistance; Socioeconomic Factors; Thinness [economics, *prevention & control]","10.3945/jn.116.233684","https://www.cochranelibrary.com/central/doi/10.1002/central/CN-01382558/full","Public Health"

Existing interventions are effective under controlled conditions; however, little information is available on their effectiveness in large‐scale programs. OBJECTIVE: To document the short‐term nutritional impact of a large‐scale, incentive‐based development program in Mexico (Progresa), which included a nutritional component. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A randomized effectiveness study of 347 communities randomly assigned to immediate incorporation to the program in 1998 (intervention group; n = 205) or to incorporation in 1999 (crossover intervention group; n = 142). A random sample of children in those communities was surveyed at baseline and at 1 and 2 years afterward. Participants were from low‐income households in poor rural communities in 6 central Mexican states. Children (N = 650) 12 months of age or younger (n = 373 intervention group; n = 277 crossover intervention group) were included in the analyses. INTERVENTION: Children and pregnant and lactating women in participating households received fortified nutrition supplements, and the families received nutrition education, health care, and cash transfers. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Two‐year height increments and anemia rates as measured by blood hemoglobin levels in participating children. RESULTS: Progresa was associated with better growth in height among the poorest and younger infants. Age‐ and length‐adjusted height was greater by 1.1 cm (26.4 cm in the intervention group vs 25.3 cm in the crossover intervention group) among infants younger than 6 months at baseline and who lived in the poorest households. After 1 year, mean hemoglobin values were higher in the intervention group (11.12 g/dL; 95% confidence interval [CI], 10.9‐11.3 g/dL) than in the crossover intervention group (10.75 g/dL; 95% CI, 10.5‐11.0 g/dL) who had not yet received the benefits of the intervention (P =.01). There were no differences in hemoglobin levels between the 2 groups at year 2 after both groups were receiving the intervention. The age‐adjusted rate of anemia (hemoglobin level <11 g/dL) in 1999 was higher in the crossover intervention group than in the intervention group (54.9% vs 44.3%; P =.03), whereas in 2000 the difference was not significant (23.0% vs 25.8%, respectively; P =.40). CONCLUSION: Progresa, a large‐scale, incentive‐based development program with a nutritional intervention, is associated with better growth and lower rates of anemia in low‐income, rural infants and children in Mexico.","291","21","2563‐2570","Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL)","PUBMED 15173147","EMBASE 38702774",,,,"Journal article","Anemia [*epidemiology]; Child, Preschool; Cross‐Over Studies; Dietary Supplements; Growth; Health Promotion; Hemoglobins [metabolism]; Humans; Infant; Mexico; Nutrition Assessment; Poverty; Program Evaluation; Rural Population; Social Welfare","10.1001/jama.291.21.2563","https://www.cochranelibrary.com/central/doi/10.1002/central/CN-00559916/full","Developmental, Psychosocial and Learning Problems; Child Health; Consumers and Communication; Complementary Medicine; Effective Practice and Organisation of Care; SR-HEALTHP; Public Health"

We investigated the effect of Oportunidades on children almost 10 years after the programme began. METHODS: From April, 1998, to October, 1999, low‐income communities were randomly assigned to be enrolled in Oportunidades immediately (early treatment, n=320) or 18 months later (late treatment, n=186). In 2007, when 1093 children receiving early treatment and 700 late treatment in these communities were aged 8‐10 years, they were assessed for outcomes including physical growth, cognitive and language development, and socioemotional development. The primary objective was to investigate outcomes associated with an additional 18 months in the programme. We used cluster‐adjusted t tests and multivariate regressions to compare effects of programme participation for height‐for‐age, body‐mass index (BMI), and cognitive language and behavioural assessment scores in early versus late treatment groups. FINDINGS: Early enrolment reduced behavioural problems for all children in the early versus late treatment group (mean behaviour problem score ‐0.09 [SD 0.97] vs 0.13 [1.03]; p=0.0024), but we identified no difference between groups for mean height‐for‐age Z scores (‐1.12 [0.96] vs ‐1.14 [0.97]; p=0.88), BMI‐for‐age Z scores (0.14 [0.99] vs 0.17 [1.06]; p=0.58), or assessment scores for language (98.8 [13.8] vs 98.4 [14.6] p=0.90) or cognition (98.8 [12.9] vs 100.2 [13.2]; p=0.26). An additional 18 months of the programme before age 3 years for children aged 8‐10 years whose mothers had no education resulted in improved child growth of about 1.5 cm assessed as height‐for‐age [corrected] Z score (beta 0.23 [0.023‐0.44] p=0.029), independently of cash received. INTERPRETATION: An additional 18 months in the Oportunidades programme has independent beneficial effects other than money, especially for women with no formal education. The money itself also has significant effects on most outcomes, adding to existing evidence for interventions in early childhood.

These developmental outcomes are important determinants of success in adulthood. Yet, remarkably little is known about whether poverty‐alleviation programs improve children's developmental outcomes. We examine how a government‐run cash transfer program for poor mothers in rural Ecuador influenced the development of young children. Random assignment at the parish level is used to identify program effects. Our data include a set of measures of cognitive ability that are not typically included in experimental or quasi‐experimental studies of the impact of cash transfers on child well‐being, as well as a set of physical health measures that may be related to developmental outcomes. The cash transfer program had positive, although modest, effects on the physical, cognitive, and socioemotional development of the poorest children in our sample.","59","1","187‐229","Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL)","PUBMED 20821896",,,,,"Journal article","Child; Child Behavior [ethnology, physiology, psychology]; Child Care [economics, history, legislation & jurisprudence, psychology]; Child Development; Child Welfare [economics, ethnology, history, legislation & jurisprudence, psychology]; Child, Preschool; Ecuador [ethnology]; Government Programs [economics, education, history, legislation & jurisprudence]; History, 20th Century; History, 21st Century; Humans; Learning Disabilities [ethnology, history, psychology]; Poverty [economics, ethnology, history, legislation & jurisprudence, psychology]; Social Behavior Disorders [ethnology, history, psychology]; Social Class [history]; Social Welfare [economics, ethnology, history, legislation & jurisprudence, psychology]; Socioeconomic Factors","10.1086/655458","https://www.cochranelibrary.com/central/doi/10.1002/central/CN-01926446/full","Public Health"

Communities that were randomly assigned to the treatment group began receiving the BDH in 2004 and those randomly assigned to the comparison group began receiving benefits two years later. Families enrolled in the BDH received a monthly cash stipend ($15USD) representing an approximate 6‐10% increase in household income. Participants analyzed in this study are children aged 12‐35 months from treatment (n = 797) and comparison (n = 399) communities in rural and urban Ecuador. Main outcomes measured were language skills (the Fundación MacArthur Inventorio del Desarollo de Habilidades Comunicativas‐Breve), height‐for‐age z‐score, and hemoglobin concentration. Results indicate that in rural areas, being randomized to receive the BDH in very early childhood led to significantly better performance on the number of words a child was saying, and on the probability that the child was combining two or more words. There were no significant effects on language development for children in urban areas and there were no effects on height‐for‐age z‐score or hemoglobin concentration in rural or urban areas. A limited number of potential pathways with respect to cognitive/language stimulation, health behaviors, and parenting quality were also explored. Findings indicate that compared to children in comparison areas, rural children in treatment areas were more likely to have received vitamin A or iron supplementation and have been bought a toy in the past six months. This study provides evidence for significant benefits of an unconditional cash transfer program for language development in very young children in rural areas.","72","9","1437‐1446","Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL)","PUBMED 21531060",,,,,"Journal article","Adolescent; Adult; Child Development; Child, Preschool; Data Collection; Ecuador; Female; Financing, Government; Health Promotion [*economics]; Humans; Infant; Male; Poverty; Social Class; Young Adult","10.1016/j.socscimed.2011.03.005","https://www.cochranelibrary.com/central/doi/10.1002/central/CN-00800347/full","Public Health"

However, questions remain as to the impact of CBIs on nutritional status and, therefore, how to incorporate them into emergency programmes to maximise their success in terms of improved nutritional outcomes. This study evaluated the effects of three different CBI modalities on nutritional outcomes in children under 5 y of age at 6 mo and at 1 y. CONCLUSIONS: In this setting, the amount of cash given was important. The larger cash transfer had the greatest effect on wasting, but only at 6 mo. Impacts at both 6 mo and at 1 y were seen for height‐based growth variables regardless of the intervention modality, indicating a trend toward nutrition resilience. Purchasing restrictions applied to food‐based voucher transfers could have unintended effects, and their use needs to be carefully planned to avoid this. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ISRCTN registry ISRCTN10761532. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We conducted a four‐arm parallel longitudinal cluster randomised controlled trial in 114 villages in Dadu District, Pakistan. The study included poor and very poor households (n = 2,496) with one or more children aged 6‐48 mo (n = 3,584) at baseline. All four arms had equal access to an Action Against Hunger‐supported programme. The three intervention arms were as follows: standard cash (SC), a cash transfer of 1,500 Pakistani rupees (PKR) (approximately US$14; 1 PKR = US$0.009543); double cash (DC), a cash transfer of 3,000 PKR; or a fresh food voucher (FFV) of 1,500 PKR; the cash or voucher amount was given every month over six consecutive months. The control group (CG) received no specific cash‐related interventions. The median total household income for the study sample was 8,075 PKR (approximately US$77) at baseline. We hypothesized that, compared to the CG in each case, FFVs would be more effective than SC, and that DC would be more effective than SC‐both at 6 mo and at 1 y‐for reducing the risk of child wasting. Primary outcomes of interest were prevalence of being wasted (weight‐for‐height z‐score [WHZ] < ‐2) and mean WHZ at 6 mo and at 1 y. The odds of a child being wasted were significantly lower in the DC arm after 6 mo (odds ratio [OR] = 0.52; 95% CI 0.29, 0.92; p = 0.02) compared to the CG. Mean WHZ significantly improved in both the FFV and DC arms at 6 mo (FFV: z‐score = 0.16; 95% CI 0.05, 0.26; p = 0.004; DC: z‐score = 0.11; 95% CI 0.00, 0.21; p = 0.05) compared to the CG. Significant differences on the primary outcome were seen only at 6 mo. All three intervention groups showed similar significantly lower odds of being stunted (height‐for‐age z‐score [HAZ] < ‐2) at 6 mo (DC: OR = 0.39; 95% CI 0.24, 0.64; p < 0.001; FFV: OR = 0.41; 95% CI 0.25, 0.67; p < 0.001; SC: OR = 0.36; 95% CI 0.22, 0.59; p < 0.001) and at 1 y (DC: OR = 0.53; 95% CI 0.35, 0.82; p = 0.004; FFV: OR = 0.48; 95% CI 0.31, 0.73; p = 0.001; SC: OR = 0.54; 95% CI 0.36, 0.81; p = 0.003) compared to the CG. Significant improvements in height‐for‐age outcomes were also seen for severe stunting (HAZ < ‐3) and mean HAZ.

However, the effectiveness of these programs differs greatly, and it remains unclear what is causing the differences in effectiveness across different programs. To shed some light on this issue, this article examines the role the specificity of policy targets, along with the incentives attached, plays in affecting the effectiveness of nutrition intervention programs. More specifically, we examined how different policy targets (and the associated incentives) affect primary students' dietary structure and (thus) their nutritional and health status by analyzing a randomized intervention in rural Northwestern China that was designed with two treatment arms. The two treatments provided the same nutrition subsidy to project students but with different policy targets, one with a specific target of ""anemia reduction"" and the other with a general target of ""malnutrition reduction"". Our analysis revealed that compared to the treatment arm with only a general policy target, the treatment arm with the specific ""anemia reduction"" target was more effective at improving students' nutritional and health status, as measured by the incidences of being anemic and underweight, presumably through helping them develop a dietary structure with more flesh meat, bean products, vegetables, and fruits.","16","16",,"Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL)","PUBMED 31412579","EMBASE 2002427453",,,,"Journal article","*Students; *child nutrition; *dietary diversity; *elementary student; *incentive; *nutrition; *nutrition policy; *nutrition policy target; *nutrition subsidy; *reward; *rural area; Adolescent; Anemia; Anemia [epidemiology, *prevention & control]; Article; Child; Child Nutrition Disorders [epidemiology, *prevention & control]; Child Nutritional Physiological Phenomena; Child, Preschool; China; China [epidemiology]; Controlled study; Female; Government Programs; Health Surveys; Health status; Human; Humans; Incidence; Male; Malnutrition; Nutritional status; Program Evaluation; Risk reduction; Rural Population; Schools; Thinness; Underweight","10.3390/ijerph16162891","https://www.cochranelibrary.com/central/doi/10.1002/central/CN-02003915/full","Public Health"

We assessed the efficacy of a cash transfer programme to reduce the risk of sexually transmitted infections in young women. METHODS: In this cluster randomised trial, never‐married women aged 13‐22 years were recruited from 176 enumeration areas in the Zomba district of Malawi and randomly assigned with computer‐generated random numbers by enumeration area (1:1) to receive cash payments (intervention group) or nothing (control group). Intervention enumeration areas were further randomly assigned with computer‐generated random numbers to conditional (school attendance required to receive payment) and unconditional (no requirements to receive payment) groups. Participants in both intervention groups were randomly assigned by a lottery to receive monthly payments ranging from US$1 to $5, while their parents were independently assigned with computer‐generated random numbers to receive $4‐10. Behavioural risk assessments were done at baseline and 12 months; serology was tested at 18 months. Participants were not masked to treatment status but counsellors doing the serologic testing were. The primary outcomes were prevalence of HIV and herpes simplex virus 2 (HSV‐2) at 18 months and were assessed by intention‐to‐treat analyses. The trial is registered, number NCT01333826. FINDINGS: 88 enumeration areas were assigned to receive the intervention and 88 as controls. For the 1289 individuals enrolled in school at baseline with complete interview and biomarker data, weighted HIV prevalence at 18 month follow‐up was 1·2% (seven of 490 participants) in the combined intervention group versus 3·0% (17 of 799 participants) in the control group (adjusted odds ratio [OR] 0·36, 95% CI 0·14‐0·91); weighted HSV‐2 prevalence was 0·7% (five of 488 participants) versus 3·0% (27 of 796 participants; adjusted OR 0·24, 0·09‐0·65). In the intervention group, we noted no difference between conditional versus unconditional intervention groups for weighted HIV prevalence (3/235 [1%] vs 4/255 [2%]) or weighted HSV‐2 prevalence (4/233 [1%] vs 1/255 [<1%]). For individuals who had already dropped out of school at baseline, we detected no significant difference between intervention and control groups for weighted HIV prevalence (23/210 [10%] vs 17/207 [8%]) or weighted HSV‐2 prevalence (17/211 [8%] vs 17/208 [8%]). INTERPRETATION: Cash transfer programmes can reduce HIV and HSV‐2 infections in adolescent schoolgirls in low‐income settings. Structural interventions that do not directly target sexual behaviour change can be important components of HIV prevention strategies.

CT programs can be an effective means of alleviating poverty and facilitating the attainment of an adequate standard of living for people's health and well‐being and other international human rights. The objective of this analysis was to compare the household socioeconomic status, school enrolment, nutritional status, and future outlook of orphaned and separated children receiving the CT compared to those not receiving a CT. METHODS: This project analyzes baseline data from a cohort of orphaned and separated children aged <19 years and non‐orphaned children living in 300 randomly selected households (HH) in 8 Locations of Uasin Gishu County, Kenya. Baseline data were analyzed using multivariable logistic and Poisson regression comparing children in CT‐HH vs. non‐CT HH. Odds ratios are adjusted (AOR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) for guardian age and sex, child age and sex, and intra‐HH correlation. RESULTS: Included in this analysis were data from 1481 children and adolescents in 300 HH (503 participants in CT, 978 in non‐CT households). Overall there were 922 (62.3%) single orphans, 324 (21.9%) double orphans, and 210 (14.2%) participants had both parents alive and were living with them. Participants in CT‐HH were less likely to have >2 pairs of clothes compared to non‐CT HH (AOR: 0.32, 95% CI: 0.16‐0.63). Those in CT HH were less likely to have missed any days of school in the preceding month (AOR: 0.62, 95% CI: 0.42‐0.94) and those aged <1‐18 years in CT‐HH were less likely to have height stunting for their age (AOR: 0.65, 95% CI: 0.47‐0.89). Participants aged at least 10 years in CT‐HH were more likely to have a positive future outlook (AOR: 1.72, 95% CI: 1.12‐2.65). CONCLUSIONS: Children and adolescents in households receiving the CT‐OVC appear to have better nutritional status, school attendance, and optimism about the future, compared to those in households not receiving the CT, in spite of some evidence of continued material deprivation. Consideration should be given to expanding the program further.","14","1","25","Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL)",,,,,,"Journal article",,"10.1186/1472-698X-14-25","https://www.cochranelibrary.com/central/doi/10.1002/central/CN-02218170/full","Public Health"
