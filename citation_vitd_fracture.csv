Heart failure","2010","BACKGROUND: Low 25‐hydroxyvitamin D levels, commonly found in older patients with heart failure, may contribute to the chronic inflammation and skeletal myopathy that lead to poor exercise tolerance. We tested whether vitamin D supplementation of patients with heart failure and vitamin D insufficiency can improve physical function and quality of life. METHODS AND RESULTS: In a randomized, parallel group, double‐blind, placebo‐controlled trial, patients with systolic heart failure aged >or=70 years with 25‐hydroxyvitamin D levels <50 nmol/L (20 ng/mL) received 100,000 U of oral vitamin D2 or placebo at baseline and 10 weeks. Outcomes measured at baseline, 10 weeks, and 20 weeks were 6‐minute walk distance, quality of life (Minnesota score), daily activity measured by accelerometry, Functional Limitations Profile, B‐type natriuretic peptide, and tumor necrosis factor‐alpha. Participants in the vitamin D group had an increase in their 25‐hydroxyvitamin D levels compared with placebo at 10 weeks (22.9 versus 2.3 nmol/L [9.2 versus 0.9 ng/mL]; P<0.001) and maintained this increase at 20 weeks. The 6‐minute walk did not improve in the treatment group relative to placebo. No significant benefit was seen on timed up and go testing, subjective measures of function, daily activity, or tumor necrosis factor. Quality of life worsened by a small, but significant amount in the treatment group relative to placebo. B‐type natriuretic peptide decreased in the treatment group relative to placebo (‐22 versus +78 pg/mL at 10 weeks; P=0.04). CONCLUSIONS: Vitamin D supplementation did not improve functional capacity or quality of life in older patients with heart failure with vitamin D insufficiency.

The goal of this study was to determine if CaD supplementation influences hip structural parameters that are associated with fracture risk. We studied 1,970 postmenopausal women enrolled in the Women's Health Initiative randomized controlled trial of CaD at one of three bone mineral density (BMD) clinical centers. Hip structural analysis software measured BMD and strength parameters on DXA scans at three regions: femoral narrow neck, intertrochanter, and shaft. Random effects models were used to test the average differences in hip BMD and geometry between intervention and placebo. There was greater preservation of hip BMD at the narrow neck with CaD relative to placebo across 6 years of intervention. CaD also altered the underlying cross‐sectional geometry at the narrow neck in the direction of greater strength, with small increases in cross‐sectional area and section modulus and a decrease in buckling ratio with CaD relative to placebo. While trends at both the intertrochanter and shaft regions were similar to those noted at the narrow neck, no significant intervention effects were evident. There was no significant interaction of CaD and age or baseline calcium levels for hip structural properties. CaD supplementation is associated with modest beneficial effects on hip structural features at the narrow neck, which may explain some of the benefit of CaD in reducing hip fracture risk.","88","3","198‐208","Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL)","PUBMED 21253715",,,,,"Journal article","Aged; Body Constitution [drug effects]; Bone Density [drug effects]; Calcium [*administration & dosage, pharmacology]; Compressive Strength [drug effects]; Dietary Supplements; Double‐Blind Method; Drug Combinations; Female; Femur [*anatomy & histology, *drug effects]; Humans; Middle Aged; Osteoporosis, Postmenopausal [physiopathology, *prevention & control]; Placebos; Postmenopause [*drug effects]; Vitamin D [*administration & dosage, pharmacology]; Women's Health","10.1007/s00223-010-9449-x","https://www.cochranelibrary.com/central/doi/10.1002/central/CN-00785020/full","Musculoskeletal; Complementary Medicine; Metabolic and Endocrine Disorders; Bone, Joint and Muscle Trauma"

METHODS: We recruited 36,282 postmenopausal women, 50 to 79 years of age, who were already enrolled in a Women's Health Initiative (WHI) clinical trial. We randomly assigned participants to receive 1000 mg of elemental [corrected] calcium as calcium carbonate with 400 IU of vitamin D3 daily or placebo. Fractures were ascertained for an average follow‐up period of 7.0 years. Bone density was measured at three WHI centers. RESULTS: Hip bone density was 1.06 percent higher in the calcium plus vitamin D group than in the placebo group (P<0.01). Intention‐to‐treat analysis indicated that participants receiving calcium plus vitamin D supplementation had a hazard ratio of 0.88 for hip fracture (95 percent confidence interval, 0.72 to 1.08), 0.90 for clinical spine fracture (0.74 to 1.10), and 0.96 for total fractures (0.91 to 1.02). The risk of renal calculi increased with calcium plus vitamin D (hazard ratio, 1.17; 95 percent confidence interval, 1.02 to 1.34). Censoring data from women when they ceased to adhere to the study medication reduced the hazard ratio for hip fracture to 0.71 (95 percent confidence interval, 0.52 to 0.97). Effects did not vary significantly according to prerandomization serum vitamin D levels. CONCLUSIONS: Among healthy postmenopausal women, calcium with vitamin D supplementation resulted in a small but significant improvement in hip bone density, did not significantly reduce hip fracture, and increased the risk of kidney stones.

OBJECTIVE: To determine whether a single annual dose of 500,000 IU of cholecalciferol administered orally to older women in autumn or winter would improve adherence and reduce the risk of falls and fracture. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A double‐blind, placebo‐controlled trial of 2256 community‐dwelling women, aged 70 years or older, considered to be at high risk of fracture were recruited from June 2003 to June 2005 and were randomly assigned to receive cholecalciferol or placebo each autumn to winter for 3 to 5 years. The study concluded in 2008. INTERVENTION: 500,000 IU of cholecalciferol or placebo. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Falls and fractures were ascertained using monthly calendars; details were confirmed by telephone interview. Fractures were radiologically confirmed. In a substudy, 137 randomly selected participants underwent serial blood sampling for 25‐hydroxycholecalciferol and parathyroid hormone levels. RESULTS: Women in the cholecalciferol (vitamin D) group had 171 fractures vs 135 in the placebo group; 837 women in the vitamin D group fell 2892 times (rate, 83.4 per 100 person‐years) while 769 women in the placebo group fell 2512 times (rate, 72.7 per 100 person‐years; incidence rate ratio [RR], 1.15; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.02‐1.30; P = .03). The incidence RR for fracture in the vitamin D group was 1.26 (95% CI, 1.00‐1.59; P = .047) vs the placebo group (rates per 100 person‐years, 4.9 vitamin D vs 3.9 placebo). A temporal pattern was observed in a post hoc analysis of falls. The incidence RR of falling in the vitamin D group vs the placebo group was 1.31 in the first 3 months after dosing and 1.13 during the following 9 months (test for homogeneity; P = .02). In the substudy, the median baseline serum 25‐hydroxycholecalciferol was 49 nmol/L. Less than 3% of the substudy participants had 25‐hydroxycholecalciferol levels lower than 25 nmol/L. In the vitamin D group, 25‐hydroxycholecalciferol levels increased at 1 month after dosing to approximately 120 nmol/L, were approximately 90 nmol/L at 3 months, and remained higher than the placebo group 12 months after dosing. CONCLUSION: Among older community‐dwelling women, annual oral administration of high‐dose cholecalciferol resulted in an increased risk of falls and fractures.

AIMS: To examine if vitamin D supplementation has a beneficial effect on mood in community‐dwelling older women; if a single annual large dose of vitamin D has a role in the prevention of depressive symptoms; and if there is an association between serum 25‐hydroxyvitamin D levels and mental health. METHOD: A double‐blind, randomised, placebo‐controlled trial of women aged 70 or older (the Vital D Study: ISRCTN83409867 and ACTR12605000658617). Participants were randomly assigned to receive 500 000 IU vitamin D(3) (cholecalciferol) orally or placebo every autumn/winter for 3‐5 consecutive years. The tools utilised at various time points were the General Health Questionnaire, the 12‐item Short Form Health Survey, the Patient Global Impression‐Improvement scale and the WHO Well‐Being Index. Serum 25‐hydroxyvitamin D levels were measured in a subset of 102 participants. RESULTS: In this non‐clinical population, no significant differences between the vitamin D and placebo groups were detected in any of the measured outcomes of mental health. Serum 25‐hydroxyvitamin D levels in the vitamin D group were 41% higher than the placebo group 12 months following their annual dose. Despite this difference, scores from the questionnaires did not differ. Furthermore, there was no interaction between those on antidepressant/anxiety medication at baseline and the treatment groups. CONCLUSIONS: The lack of improvement in indices of mental well‐being in the vitamin D group does not support the hypothesis that an annual high dose of vitamin D(3) is a practical intervention to prevent depressive symptoms in older community‐dwelling women.","198","5","357‐364","Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL)","PUBMED 21525520",,"","","","Journal article","Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Anxiety [drug therapy]; Cholecalciferol [administration & dosage, *therapeutic use]; Data Interpretation, Statistical; Depression [drug therapy, *epidemiology, prevention & control]; Double‐Blind Method; Female; Fractures, Bone [prevention & control]; Health Status; Humans; Intention to Treat Analysis; Mental Health [*statistics & numerical data]; Middle Aged; Osteoporosis [prevention & control]; Outcome Assessment, Health Care [*statistics & numerical data]; Placebos; Risk Factors; Time Factors; Vitamin D Deficiency [epidemiology]; Vitamin D [*analogs & derivatives, blood]; Vitamins [administration & dosage, *therapeutic use]","10.1192/bjp.bp.110.087544","https://www.cochranelibrary.com/central/doi/10.1002/central/CN-00788747/full","Common Mental Disorders; Complementary Medicine; Metabolic and Endocrine Disorders; Bone, Joint and Muscle Trauma"

The quality of a clinical trial is dependent on successful recruitment of the target participant group. This paper documents the successes and failures of recruiting over 2,000 women aged at least 70 years and at higher risk of falls or fractures onto a placebo‐controlled trial of six years duration. The characteristics of study participants at baseline are also described for this study. METHODS: The Vital D Study recruited older women identified at high risk of fracture through the use of an eligibility algorithm, adapted from identified risk factors for hip fracture. Participants were randomised to orally receive either 500,000 IU vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol) or placebo every autumn for five consecutive years. A variety of recruitment strategies were employed to attract potential participants. RESULTS: Of the 2,317 participants randomised onto the study, 74% (n = 1716/2317) were consented onto the study in the last five months of recruiting. This was largely due to the success of a targeted mail‐out. Prior to this only 541 women were consented in the 18 months of recruiting. A total of 70% of all participants were recruited as a result of targeted mail‐out. The response rate from the letters increased from 2 to 7% following revision of the material by a public relations company. Participant demographic or risk factor profile did not differ between those recruited by targeted mail‐outs compared with other methods. CONCLUSION: The most successful recruitment strategy was the targeted mail‐out and the response rate was no higher in the local region where the study had extensive exposure through other recruiting strategies. The strategies that were labour‐intensive and did not result in successful recruitment include the activities directed towards the GP medical centres. Comprehensive recruitment programs employ overlapping strategies simultaneously with ongoing assessment of recruitment rates. In our experience, and others direct mail‐outs work best although rights to privacy must be respected.

Calcium supplementation was not included in the study protocol. Our hypothesis was that annual feedback of calcium intake and informing women of strategies to improve calcium intake can lead to a sustained increase in the proportion of women who consume adequate levels of the mineral. Calcium intake was assessed on an annual basis using a validated short food frequency questionnaire (FFQ). Supplemental calcium intake was added to the dietary estimate. Participants and their nominated doctor were sent a letter that the participant's estimated daily calcium intake was adequate or inadequate based on a cutoff threshold of 800 mg/day. General brief statements outlining the importance of an adequate calcium intake and bone health were included in all letters. At baseline, the median daily consumption of calcium was 980 mg/day and 67 percent of 1,951 participants had calcium intake of at least 800 mg per day. Of the 644 older women advised of an inadequate calcium intake at baseline (<800 mg/day), 386 (60%) had increased their intake by at least 100 mg/day when re‐assessed twelve months later. This desirable change was sustained at 24 months after baseline with almost half of these women (303/644) consuming over 800 mg calcium per day. This study devised an efficient method to provide feedback on calcium intake to over 2,000 older women. The improvements were modest but significant and most apparent in those with a low intake at baseline. The decreased proportion of these women with an inadequate intake of calcium 12‐ and 24‐months later, suggests this might be a practical, low cost strategy to maintain an adequate calcium intake among older women.","2","9","1018‐1025","Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL)","PUBMED 22254070",,,,,"Journal article","Accidental Falls [prevention & control]; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Calcium, Dietary [*administration & dosage]; Cholecalciferol [administration & dosage]; Diet; Dietary Supplements; Double‐Blind Method; Feedback, Psychological; Female; Fractures, Bone [prevention & control]; Humans; Placebos; Seasons","10.3390/nu20901018","https://www.cochranelibrary.com/central/doi/10.1002/central/CN-00860951/full","Bone, Joint and Muscle Trauma"

The increased rate of falling in the D3 group was higher in the first 3 months postdosing (p=0.017). This temporal pattern was observed for fractures although not significant. Aim: To investigate if the increased rate of fractures is associated with change in bone turnover markers (BTM). Method: Serial biochemistry was performed on a substudy of 99 randomly selected participants. Serum 25‐ hydroxyvitamin D (25D: Diasorin) and the BTM, β Ctelopeptide (CTx ‐ resorption) and N‐terminal propeptide of type I collagen (P1NP ‐ formation) were measured by electrochemiluminescence immunoassay (Roche, Germany). Biochemistry is reported at baseline and ≥2 years later at predose, 1‐ and 3‐month postdose. Our post hoc analysis used a linear regression model for change in BTM at 1‐ and 3‐months post‐dose and included baseline BTM and % change in 25D as covariates. The analysis also tested for heterogeneity (interaction) between changes in BTM and 25D Results: The median baseline 25D was 49 nmol/L. In the D3 group, 1‐, 3‐ and 12‐month median post dose levels were 124, 93 and 62 nmol/L, respectively. At 3‐months postdose both CTx and P1NP increased with increases in 25D (estimated mean % change from predose per 50% increase in 25D was 28.7%CTx and 8.4%P1NP, p=0.024 and 0.015, respectively). There was no heterogeneity of either marker (p>0.1).

METHODS: A total of 202 postmenopausal women between 53 and 58 years of age were recruited individually and randomly assigned to one of four groups. Comparisons were made among groups of women receiving calcitonin alone (10 IU i.m. twice a month), 1 alpha‐hydroxycholecalciferol alone (0.5 microg orally twice daily), a combination of the above two agents, or no treatment. Bone mineral density (BMD) of lumber spine (L2‐4) was determined using Dual Energy X‐ray Absorptiometry. The study was carried out prospectively over a 2‐year period. RESULTS: We observed a significant increase in vertebral bone mass in the combined treatment regimen of calcitonin and 1 alpha‐hydroxycholecalciferol (3.44% at 12 months in the combination group vs 1.40,0.92, and ‐0.70% in the calcitonin alone, 1 alpha‐hydroxycholecalciferol alone, and control groups, respectively; 4.51% at 24 months in the combination group vs 2.21,1.04, and ‐3.61% in the calcitonin alone, 1 alpha‐hydroxycholecalciferol alone, and control groups, respectively). Serum PTH, osteocalcin levels and alkaline phosphatase activity decreased significantly within 12 months whereas urinary pyridinoline/creatinine ratio decreased at 24 months in the combination group. We observed mild adverse effects in 25.0% (7/28) and 30.0% (6/20) of combination regimen and calcitonin treatment cases, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The results of the study suggest that the combination treatment regimen increased vertebral bone loss in early postmenopausal women to a greater extent than did calcitonin alone or 1 alpha‐hydroxycholecalciferol alone.","40","3","229‐238","Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL)","PUBMED 11731184",,,,,"Journal article","Administration, Oral; Alkaline Phosphatase [blood]; Amino Acids [urine]; Bone Density; Calcitonin [*administration & dosage, blood]; Creatinine [urine]; Drug Administration Schedule; Drug Therapy, Combination; Female; Humans; Hydroxycholecalciferols [*administration & dosage]; Lumbar Vertebrae; Middle Aged; Osteocalcin [blood]; Osteoporosis, Postmenopausal [*prevention & control]; Parathyroid Hormone [blood]; Prospective Studies; Treatment Outcome","10.1016/s0378-5122(01)00243-2","https://www.cochranelibrary.com/central/doi/10.1002/central/CN-00408417/full","Bone, Joint and Muscle Trauma"

MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Fracture incidence and total mortality by cause. RESULTS: After five years 268 men and women had incident fractures, of whom 147 had fractures in common osteoporotic sites (hip, wrist or forearm, or vertebrae). Relative risks in the vitamin D group compared with the placebo group were 0.78 (95% confidence interval 0.61 to 0.99, P=0.04) for any first fracture and 0.67 (0.48 to 0.93, P=0.02) for first hip, wrist or forearm, or vertebral fracture. 471 participants died. The relative risk for total mortality in the vitamin D group compared with the placebo group was 0.88 (0.74 to 1.06, P=0.18).

The purpose of this prospective, single‐blind, multi‐centre study was to compare directly the efficacy of therapy with active vitamin D metabolites (2 x 0.25 μg calcitriol) and calcium therapy (1000 mg/day) under practical conditions. The most important result was a reduction in the vertebral fracture rate by 70‐80% compared with calcium therapy alone, depending on the extent of calcium malabsorption. In contrast to women over 65 years of age, women under 65 years of age exhibited no significant effect. The finding that the treatment was effective only in moderately severe osteoporosis (<5 vertebral fractures) is therapeutically relevant. A further remarkable fact is that a statistically significant reduction in the rate of peripheral fractures, by approximately 50%, was likewise achieved with 1α‐hydroxylated vitamin D3 derivatives, in contrast to calcium supplementation. On the other hand, the incidence of side‐effects was equally low in the two groups (8.5% vs. 6.1%), with only two cases of hypercalcaemia (0.4%) recorded in the calcitriol group.","19","SUPPL. 1","23‐26","Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL)",,"EMBASE 24331591",,,,"Journal article; Conference proceeding","*osteoporosis /drug therapy; *postmenopause; Adult; Aged; Clinical trial; Conference paper; Controlled study; Female; Human; Major clinical study; Multicenter study; Oral drug administration; Single blind procedure",,"https://www.cochranelibrary.com/central/doi/10.1002/central/CN-00340088/full","HS-HANDSRCH; Bone, Joint and Muscle Trauma; Complementary Medicine"

To evaluate the efficacy and safety of calcitriol (1,25‐dihydroxyvitamin D3) in the treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis, we conducted a three‐year prospective, multicenter, single‐blind study in 622 women who had one or more vertebral compression fractures. The women were randomly assigned to receive treatment with calcitriol (0.25 micrograms twice a day) or supplemental calcium (1 g of elemental calcium daily) for three years. New vertebral fractures were detected by means of lateral roentgenography of the spine each year, and calcium absorption was measured in 392 of the women. RESULTS: The women who received calcitriol had a significant reduction in the rate of new vertebral fractures during the second and third years of treatment, as compared with the women who received calcium (second year, 9.3 vs. 25.0 fractures per 100 patient‐years; third year, 9.9 vs. 31.5 fractures per 100 patient‐years; P less than 0.001). This effect was evident only in women who had had five or fewer vertebral fractures at base line (second year, 5.2 vs. 25.3 fractures per 100 patient‐years; third year, 4.2 vs. 31.0 fractures per 100 patient‐years; P less than 0.0001). The groups also differed significantly in the number of peripheral fractures; 11 such fractures occurred in 11 women in the calcitriol group, whereas 24 occurred in 22 women in the calcium group (P less than 0.05). There was no significant difference between the groups in the incidence of side effects requiring withdrawal of treatment (8.6 percent in the calcitriol group vs. 6.5 percent in the calcium group). CONCLUSIONS: Continuous treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis with calcitriol for three years is safe and significantly reduces the rate of new vertebral fractures in women with this disorder.","326","6","357‐362","Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL)","PUBMED 1729617",,,,,"Journal article","Aged; Calcitriol [administration & dosage, adverse effects, *therapeutic use]; Calcium [administration & dosage, adverse effects, *therapeutic use]; Female; Fractures, Bone [prevention & control]; Humans; Middle Aged; Osteoporosis, Postmenopausal [*drug therapy]; Prospective Studies; Spinal Fractures [etiology, prevention & control]","10.1056/NEJM199202063260601","https://www.cochranelibrary.com/central/doi/10.1002/central/CN-00080666/full","Bone, Joint and Muscle Trauma"

Each patient was randomly allocated to receive either 0.25 micrograms of calcitriol twice daily or calcium supplementation of 1,000 mg/d. If significant hypercalcemia developed (greater than 2.6 mmol/L) or a deterioration in renal function was observed, the dose of trial medication was to be halved or stopped if laboratory values did not return to normal. Patients were given no specific instructions regarding dietary calcium intake. To date, 528 patient‐years experience with calcitriol and 527 patient‐years experience with calcium the calcium supplementation have been accumulated. Thus far, low‐dose calcitriol has not been observed to cause hypercalcemia, deterioration in renal function, or nephrocalcinosis. At 1 year, a loss in total anterior height (P less than .05) has been detected in the calcium‐treated group compared with the calcitriol‐treated group.

Patients with existing vertebral fracture have a heightened risk of further recurrent vertebral fracture. The efficacy of new osteoporosis therapies is often compared to calcium supplementation. 1,25‐dihydroxyvitamin D3 (calcitriol) acts through the vitamin D receptor (VDR) and is effective at reducing recurrent vertebral fracture risk. Because the VDR controls calcium metabolism, we hypothesized that genetic variation at the VDR locus may influence response to both calcium and calcitriol therapy. Postmenopausal women with osteoporosis from a 3‐year study comparing calcitriol versus calcium for prevention of vertebral fractures were genotyped for VDR alleles detected by FokI, BsmI, ApaI and TaqI. Data were analysed by hierarchical log‐linear analysis and robust analysis of variance for relationships to fracture outcomes. Significant differences in the vertebral fracture rate in response to calcium therapy were observed between VDR genotypes (P<0.001). Calcium appeared to be equally effective as calcitriol in particular genotypes. The response to calcitriol therapy was most pronounced in patients carrying the TaqI t allele in combination with the FokI f initiation codon variant: f+t+ carriers were 11.3‐fold less likely to sustain recurrent vertebral fracture in the last 2 years of the trial while on calcitriol therapy compared to calcium (P=1.4x10(‐5)). Response to both calcium and calcitriol therapy is dependent on genetic variation at the VDR locus and two loci in the VDR gene may contribute to this effect.","15","2","127‐135","Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL)","PUBMED 15861036","EMBASE 40562989",,,,"Journal article","*Genotype; *calcitriol/dt [Drug Therapy]; *genetic polymorphism; *osteoporosis/dt [Drug Therapy]; *vertebra fracture/co [Complication]; *vertebra fracture/pc [Prevention]; *vitamin D receptor; Allele; Alleles; Article; Calcitriol [*pharmacology]; Calcium [metabolism]; Calcium metabolism; Calcium/do [Drug Dose]; Calcium/dt [Drug Therapy]; Clinical Trials as Topic; Codon; Controlled study; Diet supplementation; Female; Fracture/co [Complication]; Fracture/pc [Prevention]; Fractures, Bone; Genetic Markers; Genetic Variation; Genomic DNA; Genotype; Heterozygote; Human; Humans; Major clinical study; Nucleotide sequence; Osteoporosis [*drug therapy, *genetics]; Osteoporosis, Postmenopausal [drug therapy]; Polymerase chain reaction; Postmenopause; Postmenopause osteoporosis/dt [Drug Therapy]; Priority journal; Receptors, Calcitriol [*genetics]; Risk; Spine radiography; Treatment Outcome","10.1097/01213011-200502000-00008","https://www.cochranelibrary.com/central/doi/10.1002/central/CN-00575775/full","Bone, Joint and Muscle Trauma"

Previous research indicates that an annual intramuscular injection of vitamin D may reduce fracture rates in this group. This strategy requires validation in a population setting. METHODS: Randomized, double‐blind, placebo‐controlled trial of 300,000 IU intramuscular (i.m.) vitamin D2 (ergocalciferol) injection or matching placebo every autumn over 3 years. 9440 people (4354 men and 5086 women) aged 75 yrs and over were recruited from general practice registers in Wessex, England. Primary outcome measure was all non‐vertebral fracture. Secondary outcomes were hip and wrist fractures, and all falls. RESULTS: 585 subjects had incident non‐spine fractures (hip 110, wrist 116, ankle 37).

Few data exist on the association between knee pain and fracture. We examined the association of knee OA and knee pain with fracture and falls in elderly men and women. METHODS: The study group comprised 6,641 men and women ages > or =75 years who participated in a 3‐year randomized controlled trial of intramuscular vitamin D therapy. Patients completed a questionnaire about knee pain and OA. Fracture and fall data were collected prospectively every 6 months. RESULTS: Knee pain prevalence and a clinician diagnosis of knee OA were 35.2% and 6.8%, respectively. A total of 436 incident nonvertebral fractures were reported, and 3,992 patients sustained a fall. Prevalent knee pain was associated with an increased risk of falls (hazard ratio [HR] 1.26, 95% confidence interval [95% CI] 1.17‐1.36) and hip fracture (HR 2.0, 95% CI 1.18‐3.37). Increasing severity of knee pain was associated with a greater risk of falls and hip fracture. Clinician diagnosis of knee OA was associated with an increased risk of nonvertebral fractures (HR 1.61, 95% CI 1.09‐2.36). The increased risk of fracture was not substantially reduced by adjusting for falls, but was attenuated by adjustment for the use of walking aids. CONCLUSION: Patients with a clinical diagnosis of knee OA and with knee pain have an increased risk of nonvertebral and hip fracture. This is not explained by the increased risk of falls, but is more likely to be due to the severity of falls sustained. Knee pain and OA should be regarded as independent risk factors for fracture.","55","4","610‐615","Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL)","PUBMED 16874784",,,,,"Journal article","Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Double‐Blind Method; Female; Fractures, Bone [*epidemiology, prevention & control]; Hip Fractures [epidemiology]; Humans; Injections, Intramuscular; Knee Joint [*physiopathology]; Male; Osteoarthritis [*complications, drug therapy, *physiopathology]; Pain [*physiopathology]; Placebos; Surveys and Questionnaires; Vitamin D [administration & dosage, *therapeutic use]; Walking","10.1002/art.22088","https://www.cochranelibrary.com/central/doi/10.1002/central/CN-00566905/full","Musculoskeletal; Bone, Joint and Muscle Trauma"

Vitamin D and calcium supplements are often recommended for fracture prevention. We aimed to assess whether vitamin D3 and calcium, either alone or in combination, were effective in prevention of secondary fractures. METHODS: In a factorial‐design trial, 5292 people aged 70 years or older (4481 [85%] of whom were women) who were mobile before developing a low‐trauma fracture were randomly assigned 800 IU daily oral vitamin D3, 1000 mg calcium, oral vitamin D3 (800 IU per day) combined with calcium (1000 mg per day), or placebo. Participants who were recruited in 21 UK hospitals were followed up for between 24 months and 62 months. Analysis was by intention‐to‐treat and the primary outcome was new low‐energy fractures. FINDINGS: 698 (13%) of 5292 participants had a new low‐trauma fracture, 183 (26%) of which were of the hip. The incidence of new, low‐trauma fractures did not differ significantly between participants allocated calcium and those who were not (331 [12.6%] of 2617 vs 367 [13.7%] of 2675; hazard ratio (HR) 0.94 [95% CI 0.81‐1.09]); between participants allocated vitamin D3 and those who were not (353 [13.3%] of 2649 vs 345 [13.1%] of 2643; 1.02 [0.88‐1.19]); or between those allocated combination treatment and those assigned placebo (165 [12.6%] of 1306 vs 179 [13.4%] of 1332; HR for interaction term 1.01 [0.75‐1.36]).

By 24 months, 2886 (54.5%) of 5292 were still taking tablets, 451 (8.5%) had died, 58 (1.1%) had withdrawn, and 1897 (35.8%) had stopped taking tablets but were still providing data for at least the main outcomes. Compliance with tablets containing calcium was significantly lower (difference: 9.4% [95% CI 6.6‐12.2]), partly because of gastrointestinal symptoms. However, potentially serious adverse events were rare and did not differ between groups. INTERPRETATION: The findings do not support routine oral supplementation with calcium and vitamin D3, either alone or in combination, for the prevention of further fractures in previously mobile elderly people.","365","9471","1621‐1628","Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL)","PUBMED 15885294","EMBASE 40693411",,,,"Journal article","*calcium carbonate/ae [Adverse Drug Reaction]; *calcium carbonate/cb [Drug Combination]; *calcium carbonate/cm [Drug Comparison]; *calcium carbonate/ct [Clinical Trial]; *calcium carbonate/dt [Drug Therapy]; *calcium carbonate/pd [Pharmacology]; *calcium carbonate/po [Oral Drug Administration]; *colecalciferol/ae [Adverse Drug Reaction]; *colecalciferol/cb [Drug Combination]; *colecalciferol/cm [Drug Comparison]; *colecalciferol/ct [Clinical Trial]; *colecalciferol/dt [Drug Therapy]; *colecalciferol/pd [Pharmacology]; *colecalciferol/po [Oral Drug Administration]; *elderly care; *fracture/dt [Drug Therapy]; *fracture/pc [Prevention]; *secondary prevention; Accidental Falls; Administration, Oral; Age distribution; Aged; Analytic method; Article; Bone radiography; Calcium [*administration & dosage, adverse effects]; Cause of death; Cholecalciferol [*administration & dosage]; Clinical trial; Controlled clinical trial; Controlled study; Drug screening; Factorial analysis; Falling; Female; Follow up; Fractures, Bone [etiology, *prevention & control]; Gastrointestinal toxicity/si [Side Effect]; Hip fracture/dt [Drug Therapy]; Hip fracture/pc [Prevention]; Hospital; Human; Humans; Hypercalcemia/si [Side Effect]; Incidence; Kidney failure/si [Side Effect]; Major clinical study; Male; Nephrolithiasis/si [Side Effect]; Osteoporosis [complications]; Patient compliance; Patient selection; Placebo; Priority journal; Quality of life; Randomized controlled trial; Side effect/si [Side Effect]; Statistical significance; Treatment outcome; Treatment withdrawal; United Kingdom","10.1016/S0140-6736(05)63013-9","https://www.cochranelibrary.com/central/doi/10.1002/central/CN-00511891/full","Musculoskeletal; Bone, Joint and Muscle Trauma; Metabolic and Endocrine Disorders"

OBJECTIVE: The aim was to evaluate the effect of vitamin D added to calcium supplementation on hip dual‐energy x‐ray absorptiometry BMD and calcium‐related analytes. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: The study was a 5‐yr randomized, controlled, double‐blind trial of 120 community‐dwelling women aged 70‐80 yr. INTERVENTIONS: The interventions were 1200 mg/d calcium with placebo vitamin D (Ca group) or with 1000 IU/d vitamin D2 (CaD group), or double placebo (control). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Hip BMD, plasma 25‐hydroxyvitamin D, biomarkers of bone turnover, PTH, and intestinal calcium absorption were measured. RESULTS: Hip BMD was preserved in CaD (‐0.17%) and Ca (0.19%) groups but not controls (‐1.27%) at yr 1 and maintained in the CaD group only at yr 3 and 5. The beneficial effects were mainly in those with baseline 25‐hydroxyvitamin D levels below the median (68 nmol/liter). At yr 1, compared with controls, the Ca and CaD groups had 6.8 and 11.3% lower plasma alkaline phosphatase, respectively (P<or=0.02), and 28.7 and 34.5% lower urinary deoxypyridinoline to creatinine ratio, respectively (P<or=0.05). At 5 yr, this suppression was maintained only in the CaD group. CaD reduced PTH at 3 and 5 yr cf. controls (27.8 and 31.3%, P<or=0.005) in those with baseline PTH levels above the median (3.6 pmol/liter). Therapy did not affect intestinal calcium absorption at high carrier loads. CONCLUSIONS: Addition of vitamin D to calcium has long‐term beneficial effects on bone density in elderly women living in a sunny climate, probably mediated by a long‐term reduction in bone turnover rate.","93","3","743‐749","Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL)","PUBMED 18089701",,,,,"Journal article","Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Ambulatory Care; Bone Density; Calcium [*administration & dosage, metabolism]; Dietary Supplements; Double‐Blind Method; Female; Humans; Intestinal Absorption; Parathyroid Hormone [blood]; Patient Compliance; Vitamin D [*administration & dosage, analogs & derivatives, blood]","10.1210/jc.2007-1466","https://www.cochranelibrary.com/central/doi/10.1002/central/CN-00628889/full","Complementary Medicine; Musculoskeletal; Bone, Joint and Muscle Trauma; Metabolic and Endocrine Disorders"

The aim of this study is to evaluate the relative importance of vitamin D and calcium treatment on BMD and bone‐related chemistry in elderly women with vitamin D insufficiency. Three hundred two elderly women (age, 77.2 +/‐ 4.6 yr) with serum 25(OH)D concentrations <60 nM participated in a 1‐yr randomized, double‐blind, placebo‐controlled trial. All subjects received 1000 mg calcium citrate per day with either 1000 IU ergocalciferol (vitamin D(2)) or identical placebo (control). The effects of time and time treatment interactions were evaluated by repeated‐measures ANOVA. At baseline, calcium intake was 1100 mg/d, and 25(OH)D was 44.3 +/‐ 12.9 nM; this increased in the vitamin D group by 34% but not the control group after 1 year (59.8 +/‐ 13.8 versus 45.0 +/‐ 13.3 nM, p < 0.001). Total hip and total body BMD increased significantly, and procollagen type I intact N‐terminal propeptide (PINP) decreased during the study with no difference between the treatment groups (hip BMD change: vitamin D, +0.5%; control, +0.2%; total body BMD change: vitamin D, +0.4%; control, +0.4%; PINP change: vitamin D, ‐3.9%; placebo, ‐2.8%). Although the fasting plasma and urine calcium increased in both groups equally, there was no detectable change in serum PTH. The increase in 25(OH)D achieved with vitamin D supplementation had no extra effect on active fractional intestinal calcium absorption, which fell equally in both groups (vitamin D, ‐17.4%; control, ‐14.8%). In patients with a baseline calcium intake of 1100 mg/d and vitamin D insufficiency, vitamin D(2) 1000 IU for 1 year has no extra beneficial effect on bone structure, bone formation markers, or intestinal calcium absorption over an additional 1000 mg of calcium.

We evaluated the effect of ergocalciferol and calcium citrate supplementation compared with calcium alone on the risk of falls in older women at high risk of falling. METHODS: A 1‐year population‐based, double‐blind, randomized controlled trial of 302 community‐dwelling ambulant older women aged 70 to 90 years living in Perth, Australia (latitude, 32 degrees S), with a serum 25‐hydroxyvitamin D concentration of less than 24.0 ng/mL and a history of falling in the previous year. Participants were randomized to receive ergocalciferol, 1000 IU/d, or identical placebo (hereinafter, ergocalciferol and control groups, respectively). Both groups received calcium citrate, 1000 mg/d. Fall data were collected every 6 weeks. RESULTS: Ergocalciferol therapy reduced the risk of having at least 1 fall over 1 year after adjustment for baseline height, which was significantly different between the 2 groups (ergocalciferol group, 53.0%; control group, 62.9%; odds ratio [OR], 0.61; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.37‐0.99). When those who fell were grouped by the season of first fall or the number of falls they had, ergocalciferol treatment reduced the risk of having the first fall in winter and spring (ergocalciferol group, 25.2%; control group, 35.8%; OR, 0.55; 95% CI, 0.32‐0.96) but not in summer and autumn, and reduced the risk of having 1 fall (ergocalciferol group, 21.2%; control group, 33.8%; OR, 0.50; 95% CI, 0.28‐0.88) but not multiple falls. CONCLUSION: Patients with a history of falling and vitamin D insufficiency living in sunny climates benefit from ergocalciferol supplementation in addition to calcium, which is associated with a 19% reduction in the relative risk of falling, mostly in winter.","168","1","103‐108","Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL)","PUBMED 18195202",,,,,"Journal article","Accidental Falls [*prevention & control]; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Bone Density Conservation Agents [*administration & dosage]; Calcium Citrate [*administration & dosage]; Dietary Supplements; Double‐Blind Method; Ergocalciferols [*administration & dosage]; Female; Humans; Treatment Outcome; Vitamin D Deficiency [drug therapy]","10.1001/archinternmed.2007.31","https://www.cochranelibrary.com/central/doi/10.1002/central/CN-00622253/full","Injuries; Bone, Joint and Muscle Trauma; Metabolic and Endocrine Disorders"

PARTICIPANTS: 3314 women aged 70 and over with one or more risk factors for hip fracture: any previous fracture, low body weight (< 58 kg), smoker, family history of hip fracture, or fair or poor self reported health. INTERVENTION: Daily oral supplementation using 1000 mg calcium with 800 IU cholecaliferol and information leaflet on dietary calcium intake and prevention of falls, or leaflet only (control group). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Primary outcome measure was all clinical fractures and secondary outcome measures were adherence to treatment, falls, and quality of life (measured with the SF‐12). RESULTS: 69% of the women who completed the follow‐up questionnaire at 24 months were still taking supplements (55% with inclusion of randomised participants known to be alive). After a median follow‐up of 25 months (range 18 to 42 months), clinical fracture rates were lower than expected in both groups but did not significantly differ for all clinical fractures (odds ratio for fracture in supplemented group 1.01, 95% confidence interval 0.71 to 1.43). The odds ratio for hip fracture was 0.75 (0.31 to 1.78). The odds of a woman having a fall at six and 12 months was 0.99 and 0.98, respectively.

Additionally, parameters of muscle function improved significantly. INTRODUCTION: The efficacy of vitamin D and calcium supplementation on risk of falling in the elderly is discussed controversially. Randomized controlled trials using falls as primary outcome are needed. We investigated long‐term effects of calcium and vitamin D on falls and parameters of muscle function in community‐dwelling elderly women and men. METHODS: Our study population consisted of 242 individuals recruited by advertisements and mailing lists (mean [ +/‐ SD] age, 77 +/‐ 4 years). All serum 25‐hydroxyvitamin D (25[OH]D) levels were below 78 nmol/l. Individuals received in a double blinded fashion either 1000 mg of calcium or 1000 mg of calcium plus 800 IU of vitamin D per day over a treatment period of 12 months, which was followed by a treatment‐free but still blinded observation period of 8 months. Falls were documented using diaries. The study took place in Bad Pyrmont, Germany (latitude 52 degrees ) and Graz, Austria (latitude 46 degrees ). RESULTS: Compared to calcium mono, supplementation with calcium plus vitamin D resulted in a significant decrease in the number of subjects with first falls of 27% at month 12 (RR = 0.73; CI = 0.54‐0.96) and 39% at month 20 (RR = 0.61; CI = 0.34‐0.76). Concerning secondary endpoints, we observed significant improvements in quadriceps strength of 8%, a decrease in body sway of 28%, and a decrease in time needed to perform the TUG test of 11%. DISCUSSION: Combined calcium and vitamin D supplementation proved superior to calcium alone in reducing the number of falls and improving muscle function in community‐dwelling older individuals.","20","2","315‐322","Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL)","PUBMED 18629569",,,,,"Journal article","Accidental Falls [*prevention & control]; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Austria; Calcium [*administration & dosage]; Double‐Blind Method; Drug Therapy, Combination; Female; Follow‐Up Studies; Fractures, Bone [prevention & control]; Germany; Humans; Male; Muscles [*physiology]; Proportional Hazards Models; Social Environment; Statistics, Nonparametric; Time Factors; Treatment Outcome; Vitamin D [*administration & dosage]","10.1007/s00198-008-0662-7","https://www.cochranelibrary.com/central/doi/10.1002/central/CN-00723315/full","Complementary Medicine; Bone, Joint and Muscle Trauma"

Increased bone fragility caused by secondary hyperparathyroidism (sHPT) and impaired balance are known risk factors for hip fractures. The hypothesis is that short‐term therapy with calcium and vitamin D may improve body sway as well as sHPT more effectively than calcium monotherapy. The effects of 8 weeks of supplementation with vitamin D (cholecalciferol) and calcium on body sway and biochemical measures of bone metabolism were measured. The sample consisted of 148 women (mean [+/‐SD] age, 74 +/‐ 1 years) with a 25‐hydroxycholecalciferol level below 50 nmol/liter. They received either 1200 mg of calcium plus 800 IU of vitamin D or 1200 mg of calcium per day. We measured intact parathyroid hormone (PTH), markers of bone turnover, and body sway before and after treatment. Falls and fractures among the participants were followed over a 1‐year period. Compared with calcium mono, supplementation with vitamin D and calcium resulted in an increase in serum 25‐hydroxyvitamin D of 72% (p < 0.0001), a decrease in the serum PTH of 18% ( p = 0.0432), and a decrease in body sway of 9% (p = 0.0435).

A daily dietary supplement of 750 mg calcium or 15 microg 25OH vitamin D3 on bone loss at the hip and other sites, bone turnover and calcium‐regulating hormones were studied over 4 yr in elderly volunteers using a randomized, double‐blind, placebo‐controlled trial. Bone mineral density (BMD) was measured by dual x‐ray absorptiometry and bone structure by radiographs. Calcium biochemistry and bone turnover markers were measured in blood and urine. The 316 women entering the trial had a mean age of 73.7 yr and the 122 men of 75.9 yr. Baseline median calcium intake was 546 mg/day, and median serum 25OH vitamin D3 was 59 nmol/L. On placebo, loss of BMD at total hip was 2% and femoral medulla expansion was 3% over 4 yr. Calcium reduced bone loss, secondary hyperparathyroidism, and bone turnover. 25OH vitamin D3 was intermediate between placebo and calcium. Fracture rates and drop‐out rates were similar among groups, and there were no serious adverse events with either supplement. A calcium supplement of 750 mg/day prevents loss of BMD, reduces femoral medullary expansion, secondary hyperparathyroidism, and high bone turnover. A supplement of 15 microg/day 25OH vitamin D3 is less effective, and because its effects are seen only at low calcium intakes, suggests that its beneficial effect is to reverse calcium insufficiency.","85","9","3011‐3019","Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL)","PUBMED 10999778",,,,,"Journal article","Aged; Biomarkers; Bone Density; Bone and Bones [anatomy & histology, diagnostic imaging]; Calcifediol [blood, *pharmacology]; Calcium [blood, metabolism, *pharmacology]; Dietary Supplements; Double‐Blind Method; Female; Hip [*physiology]; Hormones [metabolism]; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Osteoporosis [*drug therapy, pathology]; Parathyroid Hormone [blood]; Radiography","10.1210/jcem.85.9.6836","https://www.cochranelibrary.com/central/doi/10.1002/central/CN-00299627/full","Complementary Medicine; Bone, Joint and Muscle Trauma"

A 3-year randomized population-based trial (OSTPRE-FPS)","Maturitas","2010","OBJECTIVE: The hypothesis was that the calcium and vitamin D supplementation prevents falls at the population level.Study design: The OSTPRE‐FPS was a randomized population‐based open‐trial with 3‐year follow‐up. The supplementation group (n=1566) received daily cholecalciferol 800IU+calcium carbonate 1000mg, while the control group (n=1573) received no supplementation or placebo. A randomly selected subsample of 593 subjects underwent a detailed measurement program including serum 25(OH)D measurements. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: The occurrence of falls was the primary outcome of the study. The participants in the subsample were telephoned at 4 months intervals and the rest of the trial population was interviewed by phone once a year. RESULTS: In the entire trial population (ETP), there were 812 women with 1832 falls in the intervention group and 833 women with 1944 falls in the control group (risk ratio was 0.98, 95% CI 0.92‐1.05, P=0.160). The supplementation was not associated with single or multiple falls in the ETP. However, in the subsample, multiple fall incidence decreased by 30% (odds ratio (OR) 0.70, 95% CI 0.50‐0.97, P=0.034) in the supplementation group. Further, the supplementation decreased the incidence of multiple falls requiring medical attention (OR 0.72, 95% CI 0.53‐0.97, P=0.031) in the ETP. The mean compliance in the entire trial population was 78% and in the subsample 79%. DISCUSSION: Overall, the primary analysis showed no association between calcium and vitamin D supplementation and risk of falls. However, the results of a post hoc analysis suggested that there was a decreased risk of multiple falls requiring medical attention: this finding requires confirmation.","65","4","359‐365","Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL)","PUBMED 20060665",,,,,"Journal article","Accidental Falls [*prevention & control]; Aged; Calcium [*administration & dosage, adverse effects]; Female; Humans; Patient Compliance; Vitamin D [*administration & dosage, adverse effects, analogs & derivatives, blood]; Vitamins [*administration & dosage, adverse effects]","10.1016/j.maturitas.2009.12.018","https://www.cochranelibrary.com/central/doi/10.1002/central/CN-00750217/full","Complementary Medicine; Bone, Joint and Muscle Trauma; Metabolic and Endocrine Disorders"

The supplementation group (n = 287) received daily cholecalciferol 800 IU + calcium 1,000 mg for 3 years while the control group (n = 306) received neither supplementation nor placebo. Daily vitamin D and calcium supplementation have a positive effect on the skeleton in ambulatory postmenopausal women. INTRODUCTION: vitamin D deficiency is common in the elderly, and vitamin D levels are associated with low bone mineral density (BMD). The working hypothesis was that vitamin D and calcium supplementation could prevent bone loss in ambulatory postmenopausal women. METHODS: the OSTPRE‐FPS was a randomized population‐based open trial with a 3‐year follow‐up in 3,432 women (aged 66 to 71 years). A randomly selected subsample of 593 subjects underwent BMD measurements. The supplementation group (n = 287) received daily cholecalciferol 800 IU + calcium 1,000 mg for 3 years while the control group (n = 306) received neither supplementation nor placebo. RESULTS: in the intention‐to‐treat analysis, total body BMD (n = 362) increased significantly more in the intervention group than in the control group (0.84% vs. 0.19%, p = 0.011). The BMD change differences at the lumbar spine (p = 0.372), femoral neck (p = 0.188), trochanter (p = 0.085), and total proximal femur (p = 0.070) were statistically nonsignificant. Analyses in compliant women (≥ 80% of use) resulted in stronger and statistically significant effects at the total body and femoral regions. CONCLUSION: daily vitamin D and calcium supplementation have a positive effect on the skeleton in ambulatory postmenopausal women with adequate nutritional calcium intake.","21","12","2047‐2055","Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL)","PUBMED 20204604",,"","","","Journal article","Aged; Bone Density Conservation Agents [adverse effects, *therapeutic use]; Bone Density [*drug effects]; Calcium [adverse effects, *therapeutic use]; Cholecalciferol [adverse effects, *therapeutic use]; Dietary Supplements; Drug Therapy, Combination; Female; Follow‐Up Studies; Humans; Osteoporosis, Postmenopausal [physiopathology, *prevention & control]; Treatment Outcome; Vitamin D [analogs & derivatives, blood]","10.1007/s00198-009-1167-8","https://www.cochranelibrary.com/central/doi/10.1002/central/CN-00781524/full","Complementary Medicine; Metabolic and Endocrine Disorders; Bone, Joint and Muscle Trauma"

OBJECTIVE: We determined whether vitamin D supplementation, with or without calcium, improved glucose homeostasis in adults at high risk of diabetes. DESIGN: Ninety‐two adults were randomly assigned in a 2‐by‐2 factorial‐design, double‐masked, placebo‐controlled trial to receive either cholecalciferol (2000 IU once daily) or calcium carbonate (400 mg twice daily) for 16 wk. The primary outcome was the change in pancreatic β cell function as measured by the disposition index after an intravenous‐glucose‐tolerance test. Other outcomes were acute insulin response, insulin sensitivity, and measures of glycemia. RESULTS: Participants had a mean age of 57 y, a body mass index (BMI; in kg/m(2)) of 32, and glycated hemoglobin (Hb A(1c)) of 5.9%. There was no significant vitamin D × calcium interaction on any outcomes. The disposition index increased in the vitamin D group and decreased in the no‐vitamin D group (adjusted mean change ± SE: 300 ± 130 compared with ‐126 ± 127, respectively; P = 0.011), which was explained by an improvement in insulin secretion (62 ± 39 compared with ‐36 ± 37 mU · L(‐1) · min, respectively; P = 0.046). Hb A(1c) increased less, but nonsignificantly, in the vitamin D group than in the no‐vitamin D group (0.06 ± 0.03% compared with 0.14 ± 0.03%, respectively; P = 0.081). There was no significant difference in any outcomes with calcium compared with no calcium. CONCLUSION: In adults at risk of type 2 diabetes, short‐term supplementation with cholecalciferol improved β cell function and had a marginal effect on attenuating the rise in Hb A(1c).

We examined the effect of vitamin D supplementation on fracture rate in people living in sheltered accommodation. METHODS: In a pragmatic double blind randomised controlled trial of 3 years duration, we examined 3,440 people (2,624 women and 816 men) living in residential or care home. We used four‐monthly oral supplementation using 100,000 IU vitamin D(2) (ergocalciferol). As a main outcome measure, we used the incidence of first fracture using an intention to treat analysis. This was a multicentre study in 314 care homes or sheltered accommodation complexes in South Wales, UK. RESULTS: The vitamin D and placebo groups had similar baseline characteristics. In intention‐to‐treat analysis, 205 first fractures occurred in the intervention group during a total of 2,846 person years of follow‐up (7 fractures per 100 people per year of follow‐up), with 218 first fractures in the control group over 2,860 person years of follow‐up.

DESIGN: Prospective, double‐blind trial. SETTING: Community setting (Amsterdam and surrounding area). PATIENTS: 2578 persons (1916 women, 662 men) 70 years of age and older (mean age +/‐ SD, 80 +/‐ 6 years) living independently, in apartments for elderly persons, or in homes for elderly persons. INTERVENTION: Participants were randomly assigned to receive either vitamin D3, 400 IU in one tablet daily, or placebo for a maximum of 3.5 years. MEASUREMENTS: Dietary calcium intake and serum 25‐hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] were estimated in a subset of participants. During follow‐up, attention was concentrated on hip fractures and other peripheral fractures. The maximal follow‐up period was 4 years. The results were evaluated by survival analysis. RESULTS: Mean dietary calcium intake from dairy products was 868 mg/d. Mean serum 25(OH)D concentration in the third year of the study was 23 nmol/L in the placebo group and 60 nmol/L in the vitamin D group.

In 1992, over a 28‐week period, falls were recorded among 354 elderly subjects aged 70 years or over who were living in homes or apartments for the elderly in Amsterdam and the vicinity. During the study period, 251 falls were reported by 126 subjects (36%), and recurrent falls (> or =2 falls) were reported by 57 subjects (16%). Associations of falls and recurrent falls with potential risk factors were identified in logistic regression models. Mobility impairment regarding one or more of the tested items (i.e., impairment of balance, leg‐extension strength, and gait) was associated with falls (adjusted odds ratio (OR) =2.6) and was strongly associated with recurrent falls (OR = 5.0). Dizziness upon standing was associated with falls (OR = 2.1) and recurrent falls (OR = 2.1). However, several risk factors were associated with recurrent falls only: history of stroke (OR = 3.4), poor mental state (OR = 2.4), and postural hypotension (OR = 2.0). The authors constructed a risk profile for recurrent falls that included the five risk factors mentioned above. Inclusion of all risk factors in the profile implied an 84% probability of recurrent falls over a period of 28 weeks, compared with 3% when no risk factor was present. The probability of recurrent falls ranged only from 11% to 29% when predicted by number of falls occurring in the previous year. Physical activity, use of high‐risk medication, and the use of vitamin D3, which was randomly allocated to the participants, were not strongly related to either falls or recurrent falls. In conclusion, a large range of probabilities of falls, especially of recurrent falls, was estimated by the risk profiles, in which mobility impairment was the major risk factor. Recurrent fallers may therefore be especially amenable to prevention based on mobility improvement.","143","11","1129‐1136","Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL)","PUBMED 8633602",,,,,"Journal article","Accidental Falls [*statistics & numerical data]; Activities of Daily Living; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Female; Geriatric Assessment; Health Status Indicators; Humans; Logistic Models; Male; Netherlands; Odds Ratio; Prospective Studies; Recurrence; Risk Factors; Urban Health","10.1093/oxfordjournals.aje.a008690","https://www.cochranelibrary.com/central/doi/10.1002/central/CN-00124829/full","Metabolic and Endocrine Disorders; Bone, Joint and Muscle Trauma"

DESIGN: A randomised controlled trial of cluster design. SETTING AND SUBJECTS: 223 Residential units (mainly identical 30‐bedded units), within 118 homes for elderly people throughout Britain, with 3,717 participating residents (76% women, average age 85 years). The units provided mainly or entirely residential care (35% of residents), nursing care (42%) or care for elderly mentally infirm (EMI) residents (23%). METHODS: Participants were randomly allocated by residential unit (cluster design) to a treated group offered ergocalciferol 2.5 mg every 3 months (equivalent to a daily dose of 1,100 IU), or to a control group. Fractures were reported by staff and confirmed in hospital, and routinely collected data on reported falls were obtained. RESULTS: After median follow‐up of 10 months (interquartile range 7‐14 months), 64 (3.6%) of 1,762 vitamin D‐treated residents and 51 (2.6%) of 1,955 controls had one or more non‐vertebral fractures, and 24 (1.3%) and 20 (1.0%), respectively, had a hip fracture. The proportion reporting at least one fall was 44% in vitamin D‐treated and 43% in control residents. The differences between the vitamin D and control groups were not statistically significant. The incidence of all non‐vertebral fractures in the care homes (3.2% per year) and of hip fractures (1.1% per year) was low, similar to rates in elderly people in sheltered accommodation, and the pre‐treatment serum 25‐hydroxy vitamin D concentration was high [median 47 nmol/l, measured in a 1% (n = 18) sample].

METHODS: A total of 464 early postmenopausal women, (a subgroup of the Kuopio Osteoporosis Study, n = 13,100) were randomized to four groups: (1) HRT, a sequential combination of 2 mg estradiol valerate and 1 mg cyproterone acetate; (2) Vit D (300 IU/day and 100 IU/day during the fifth years); (3) HRT + Vit D; and (4) placebo. Lumbar (L2‐4) and femoral neck bone mineral densities (BMD) were determined by dual X‐ray absorptiometry (DXA) at baseline, after 2.5 and 5 years of treatment. All new symptomatic non‐vertebral, radiographically defined fractures were recorded. RESULTS: Altogether, 368 women (79%) completed the 5 year treatment. In all, 32 women had 39 non‐vertebral fractures during a mean of 4.3 year follow‐up (HRT 4, Vit D 10, HRT + Vit D 8 and placebo 17). The reduction in the incidence of new non‐vertebral fractures was significant in women with HRT alone (P = 0.032) when adjusted by baseline BMD and previous fractures; observed also with the intention‐to‐treat principle (P = 0.048). When the HRT groups were pooled, HRT showed a significantly lower incidence of new non‐vertebral fractures (P = 0.042) than women receiving placebo and also after adjusting as above (P = 0.016); both in valid‐case and in the intention‐to‐treat analysis. In the Vit D group, the fracture incidence was non‐significantly decreased (P = 0.229) in comparison with the placebo group. The estimated risk of new non‐vertebral fractures among women treated with HRT alone was 0.29 (95% CI, 0.10‐0.90) and with Vit D 0.47 (95% CI, 0.20‐1.14) and with HRT + Vit D 0.44 (95% CI, 0.17‐1.15), in comparison with the placebo group (adjusted by femoral BMD and previous fractures).

However, the occurrence of women with no bone response to HRT has not been widely examined. We identified the densitometric nonresponders to long‐term HRT and investigated some characteristics and biochemical variables as possible predictors of densitometric nonresponse in postmenopausal women. The study population was a subsample of the Kuopio Osteoporosis Study (n = 14,220). A total of 464 early postmenopausal women were randomized into four treatment groups: (1) HRT (sequential combination of 2 mg estradiol valerate and 1 mg cyproterone acetate); (2) vitamin D3; (3) HRT + Vitamin D3 combined; and (4) placebo. In this study, the data from HRT and placebo groups were analyzed. Lumbar (L2‐4) and femoral neck bone mineral density (BMD) were determined by dual‐energy X‐ray absorptiometry (DXA) at baseline and after 5 years of treatment. A densitometric nonresponder was defined as a woman whose 5‐year BMD change was similar to the mean BMD change (+95% CI) of the placebo group or worse. Altogether, 74 women in the HRT group and 104 women in the placebo group complied with the treatment. According to spinal BMD analysis, 11% of the women were classified as densitometric nonresponders; the corresponding proportion for femoral BMD analysis was 26%. Both smoking (p = 0.003) and low body weight (p = 0.028) were significant risk factors for densitometric nonresponse to HRT. After 6 months of treatment the densitometric nonresponders (hip) had a significantly higher mean serum follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) level (p = 0.038) and lower increases in serum estradiol levels (p = 0.006) than the densitometric responders. The mean changes in serum FSH and alkaline phosphatase levels were significantly lower among the densitometric nonresponders (spine) than responders (p = 0.043 and 0.017, respectively). In conclusion, this prospective study shows that especially current smokers and women with low body weight are at increased risk of poor bone response to HRT. Repeated serum FSH, estradiol and alkaline phosphatase measurements during the first months of long‐term HRT may be helpful in identifying the women with no bone response to HRT.","11","3","211‐218","Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL)","PUBMED 10824236",,,,,"Journal article","Alkaline Phosphatase [blood]; Biomarkers [blood]; Body Weight; Bone Density [*drug effects]; Bone and Bones [physiopathology]; Cholecalciferol [metabolism]; Estradiol [blood]; Estrogen Replacement Therapy; Estrogens [metabolism]; Female; Follicle Stimulating Hormone [blood]; Humans; Middle Aged; Osteoporosis, Postmenopausal [blood, physiopathology, *prevention & control]; Prospective Studies; Smoking [adverse effects]; Treatment Failure","10.1007/s001980050283","https://www.cochranelibrary.com/central/doi/10.1002/central/CN-00278081/full","Musculoskeletal; Metabolic and Endocrine Disorders; Bone, Joint and Muscle Trauma"

Lumbar (L2‐L4) and femoral neck BMD were determined by dual x‐ray absorptiometry (DXA) at baseline and after 2.5 and 5 yr of treatment. Intention to treat analysis (n = 464) showed that after 5 yr, lumbar BMD remained unchanged in the HRT and HRT plus Vit D groups [+0.2% (P = 0.658) and +0.9% (P = 0.117), respectively], whereas lumbar BMD decreased by 4.6% in the Vit D group and by 4.5% in the placebo group (P < 0.001 in both).

In a randomized, double‐blind placebo‐controlled trial, we tested the hypothesis that vitamin D + calcium supplementation improves muscle strength and mobility, compared with calcium mono‐therapy in vitamin D‐insufficient female geriatric patients. METHODS: Seventy female geriatric patients >65 years of age with serum 25‐hydroxyvitamin D3 (25OHD) concentrations between 20 and 50 nmol/L, visiting an outpatient geriatric department, were included. Participants received either cholecalciferol 400 IU/day + calcium 500 mg/day (D/Cal group) or a placebo + calcium 500 mg/day (Plac/Cal group) for 6 months. At baseline and 6 months, muscle strength, power and functional mobility were tested. RESULTS: At baseline, 25OHD was significantly (p<0.05) associated with knee extension strength (r=0.42), handgrip strength (r=0.28), leg extension power (r=0.34), Timed Get Up and Go (r=‐0.31) and Modified Cooper test (r=0.44). At 6 months, a significant difference in 25OHD (77.2 vs 41.6 nmol/L, p<0.001) and 1,25OHD was found between the two groups. Significantly improving vitamin D status in the D/Cal group compared with the Plac/Cal group did not result in a significant difference in strength or functional mobility between the two groups. CONCLUSIONS: Daily 400 IU vitamin D + 500 mg calcium supplementation is not enough to significantly improve strength or mobility in vitamin D‐insufficient female geriatric patients.","22","1","78‐84","Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL)","PUBMED 20305368",,,,,"Journal article","Aged; Calcium [*therapeutic use]; Dietary Supplements; Female; Hand Strength [*physiology]; Humans; Knee Joint [physiology]; Locomotion [physiology]; Mobility Limitation; Motor Activity [drug effects, *physiology]; Muscle Strength [drug effects, *physiology]; Vitamin D Deficiency [*drug therapy, *epidemiology]; Vitamin D [*therapeutic use]","10.1007/BF03324819","https://www.cochranelibrary.com/central/doi/10.1002/central/CN-00752080/full","Complementary Medicine; Metabolic and Endocrine Disorders; Bone, Joint and Muscle Trauma"

There is little consensus about secondary prevention. Many are given calcium and vitamin D, but the evidence supporting this is circumstantial. OBJECTIVE: to compare the effects of different calcium and vitamin D supplementation regimens on bone biochemical markers, bone mineral density and rate of falls in elderly women post‐hip fracture. DESIGN: randomised controlled trial. SETTING: orthogeriatric rehabilitation ward. METHODS: 150 previously independent elderly women, recruited following surgery for hip fracture, were assigned to receive a single injection of 300,000 units of vitamin D(2), injected vitamin D(2) plus 1 g/day oral calcium, 800 units/day oral vitamin D(3) plus 1 g/day calcium, or no treatment. Follow‐up was one year, with measurement of 25‐hydroxyvitamin D, parathyroid hormone, bone mineral density, and falls. RESULTS: mean 25‐hydroxyvitamin D increased and mean parathyroid hormone was suppressed in all the actively treated groups, more so in the group receiving combined oral vitamin D and calcium. Twenty per cent of participants injected with vitamin D were deficient in 25‐hydroxyvitamin D a year later. Bone mineral density showed small but statistically significant differences of up to 4.6% between actively treated groups and placebo. Relative risk of falling in the groups supplemented with vitamin D was 0.48 (95% CI 0.26‐0.90) compared with controls. CONCLUSION: Vitamin D supplementation, either orally or with injected vitamin D, suppresses parathyroid hormone, increases bone mineral density and reduces falls. Effects may be more marked with calcium co‐supplementation. The 300,000 units of injected vitamin D may not last a whole year.","33","1","45‐51","Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL)","PUBMED 14695863",,,,,"Journal article","Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Bone Density; Calcium [*administration & dosage]; Female; Follow‐Up Studies; Hip Fractures [prevention & control, *rehabilitation]; Humans; Recurrence; Vitamin D [*administration & dosage]","10.1093/ageing/afh002","https://www.cochranelibrary.com/central/doi/10.1002/central/CN-00464431/full","Complementary Medicine; Bone, Joint and Muscle Trauma; Metabolic and Endocrine Disorders"

Lumbar spine and proximal femur bone mineral density (BMD) and biochemical indices were monitored over 2 years. In the 1alpha(OH)D3‐treated group, there was a nonsignificant decrease in lumbar spine BMD compared with controls, and no significant loss in the femoral neck compared with controls. In the estrogen‐treated group, there was a nonsignificant increase in spine BMD (+2.17% in the first year and +1.71% in the second year), and no loss in femoral neck BMD. The combination of conjugated estrogens +1alpha(OH)D3 was more effective in increasing BMD in the spine (+3. 68% in the first year and +3.63% in the second year) and femur (+2. 56% in the first year and +4.44% in the second year) BMD. There was a significant difference in lumbar spine BMD in both the first and second years between the combination‐treated group and the 1alpha(OH)D3‐treated and control groups (P < 0.01). Serum osteocalcin (OC) significantly decreased in the combination‐treated group (‐23.8% in the first year) and the estrogen‐treated group (‐37. 6% and ‐41.2% at 6 and 18 months, respectively), and serum alkaline phosphatase (Alp) decreased significantly in the first year in the combination‐treated (‐31.5%), estrogen‐treated (‐27.3%), and 1alpha(OH)D3‐treated (‐7.9%) groups, whereas serum OC increased (+45. 4% in the first year) in women without treatment. The results of this study indicate that early postmenopausal bone loss in the femoral neck is prevented by conjugated estrogens, 1alpha(OH)D3, or both, whereas bone loss in the spine is not prevented by 1alpha(OH)D3. Estrogen proves effective in preventing early postmenopausal bone loss by markedly inhibiting bone turnover. Moreover, a synergistic bone‐sparing effect can be expected when estrogen is administered concomitantly with 1alpha(OH)D3 rather than when used alone.","65","1","16‐22","Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL)","PUBMED 10369728",,,,,"Journal article","Adult; Alkaline Phosphatase [blood]; Bone Density [drug effects]; Calcium [urine]; Drug Therapy, Combination; Estrogens, Conjugated (USP) [*therapeutic use]; Female; Femur Neck [drug effects, metabolism]; Humans; Hydroxycholecalciferols [*therapeutic use]; Hydroxyproline [urine]; Lumbar Vertebrae [drug effects, metabolism]; Middle Aged; Osteocalcin [blood]; Osteoporosis, Postmenopausal [metabolism, *prevention & control]; Parathyroid Hormone [blood]; Phosphorus [urine]","10.1007/s002239900651","https://www.cochranelibrary.com/central/doi/10.1002/central/CN-00164315/full","Bone, Joint and Muscle Trauma"

However, poor adherence to therapy is a common clinical problem. To examine the effects of supervised oral 3‐monthly vitamin D therapy on falls, muscle strength, and mobility, we conducted a 9‐month randomized, double‐blind, placebo‐controlled trial in 686 community‐dwelling ambulant women aged over 70 years. Participants received either oral cholecalciferol 150,000 IU every 3 months (n = 353) or an identical placebo (n = 333). All participants were advised to increase dietary calcium intake. Falls data were collected 3‐monthly. At baseline, 3, 6, and 9 months, muscle strength was measured by a handheld dynamometer and mobility by the Timed Up and Go (TUG) test. Serum 25 hydroxyvitamin D (25OHD) was measured in a subgroup of 40 subjects. Mean age at baseline was 76.7 ± 4.1 years. The average serum 25OHD value at baseline was 65.8 ± 22.7 nmol/L. By 3, 6, and 9 months after supplementation, 25OHD levels of the vitamin D group were approximately 15 nmol/L higher than the placebo group. Calcium intake did not change significantly between baseline (864 ± 412 mg/day) and 9 months (855 ± 357 mg/day). Faller rates in the two groups did not differ: vitamin D group, 102 of 353 (29%); placebo group, 89 of 333 (27%). At 9 months, compared to placebo or baseline, muscle strength, and TUG were not altered by vitamin D. In conclusion, oral cholecalciferol 150,000 IU therapy administered 3‐monthly had neither beneficial nor adverse effects on falls or physical function. These data together with previous findings confirm that intermittent large doses of vitamin D are ineffective or have a deleterious effect on falls. Thus despite adherence issues with daily vitamin D replacement, an intermittent, high‐dose vitamin D regimen cannot be supported as a strategy to reduce falls and fractures.","27","1","170‐176","Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL)","PUBMED 21956713",,,,,"Journal article","Accidental Falls [*prevention & control]; Administration, Oral; Aged; Calcium [administration & dosage, pharmacology]; Cholecalciferol [*administration & dosage, adverse effects, *pharmacology]; Dietary Supplements; Drug Administration Schedule; Female; Humans; Life Style; Movement [*drug effects]; Muscle Strength [*drug effects]; Postmenopause [blood, *drug effects, physiology]; Vitamin D [analogs & derivatives, blood]","10.1002/jbmr.524","https://www.cochranelibrary.com/central/doi/10.1002/central/CN-00882349/full","Complementary Medicine; Metabolic and Endocrine Disorders; Bone, Joint and Muscle Trauma"

Thirty‐four out of 60 patients completed the 2 year observation period. Nandrolone decanoate statistically significantly increased the bone mineral content at the radius, reduced the endosteal bone loss at the metacarpals and statistically significantly reduced urinary calcium and hydroxyproline excretion. Calcium infusions and 1 alpha‐hydroxyvitamin D3 inhibited further loss of bone mineral content, but endosteal bone loss continued. In the second year fracture rate was reduced in the nandrolone decanoate groups compared to the two other groups. We conclude that nandrolone decanoate is an active drug for increasing bone mineral content and reducing endosteal bone loss, while 1 alpha‐hydroxyvitamin D3 and calcium infusions only stop further bone mineral loss at the radius but do not inhibit endosteal bone loss as measured at the metacarpals and that single photon absorptiometry and radiography are complementary in interpreting cortical bone mineral changes.","1","4","347‐357","Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL)","PUBMED 3333018","EMBASE 16015695",,,,"Journal article","Aged; Bone Resorption [drug effects]; Bone and Bones [metabolism]; Calcium, Dietary [*therapeutic use]; Clinical Trials as Topic; Double‐Blind Method; Female; Fractures, Bone [prevention & control]; Humans; Hydroxycholecalciferols [*therapeutic use]; Male; Middle Aged; Minerals [metabolism]; Nandrolone Decanoate; Nandrolone [*analogs & derivatives, therapeutic use]; Osteoporosis [*drug therapy, metabolism, pathology]",,"https://www.cochranelibrary.com/central/doi/10.1002/central/CN-00057017/full","Bone, Joint and Muscle Trauma"

Nearly all hip fractures are due to falls and hip fractures are the most severe of the osteoporotic fractures because they lead to a 20% mortality rate and a loss of independent living in 50% of cases. Although there are multiple factors associated with falls, our interest is the role that vitamin D metabolism plays in the pathogenesis of falls. Recent clinical trials show that both vitamin D and the metabolite calcitriol reduce the number of falls by 30‐40% in elderly subjects. This should also reduce the number of fractures. In European studies, the decrease in falls could be attributed to an improvement in the muscle weakness that often accompanies vitamin D deficiency. However, in the studies using calcitriol there was no vitamin D deficiency, so the mechanism of its efficacy is less clear. It could be due to increased muscle strength, an improvement in the neurological control of balance or both. Understanding these mechanisms would allow us to search for analogs of vitamin D that act more selectively on muscle and on the central nervous system.","89‐90","1‐5","497‐501","Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL)","PUBMED 15225827",,,,,"Journal article","Accidental Falls [*prevention & control]; Aged; Calcitriol [*therapeutic use]; Female; Humans; Osteoporosis [physiopathology, *prevention & control]; Placebos; Psychomotor Performance; United States [epidemiology]","10.1016/j.jsbmb.2004.03.059","https://www.cochranelibrary.com/central/doi/10.1002/central/CN-00481584/full","Bone, Joint and Muscle Trauma; Metabolic and Endocrine Disorders"

The treatment phase of the study was double‐blinded. After discontinuing therapy for 2 yr, there was rapid bone loss in all 3 treatment groups, and most of the decrease in BMD occurred in the first year. In the ERT/HRT group, spine BMD increased 5.5% in yr 3, decreased 3.2% in yr 4, and decreased 0.7% in yr 5; femoral neck BMD increased 3.7% in yr 3, decreased 2.5% in yr 4, and decreased 0.4% in yr 5; total body BMD increased 2.1% in yr 3, decreased 1.4% in yr 4, and decreased 0.6% in yr 5.

The main objective of this study was to examine the effect of estrogen and 1,25‐dihydroxyvitamin D therapy given individually or in combination on bone loss in elderly women. Four hundred eighty‐nine elderly women with normal bone density for their age, aged 65‐77 yr, were entered into a randomized double blind, placebo‐controlled trial. Women were randomized to one of four groups: conjugated estrogens (0.625 mg, daily) to women without a uterus (estrogen replacement therapy) plus medroxyprogesterone acetate (2.5 mg, daily) to women with a uterus (hormone replacement therapy), calcitriol (0.25 microg twice daily), a combination of hormone replacement therapy/estrogen replacement therapy plus calcitriol, or placebos for 3 yr. The primary outcome was the change in bone mineral density of the femoral neck and spine. In the intent to treat analysis, hormone therapy (hormone replacement therapy/estrogen replacement therapy) produced a mean (+/‐1 SD) increase in bone mineral density of 2.98% (+/‐5.45%) at the femoral neck (P < 0.0001) and 4.36% (+/‐6.42%) at the spine (P < 0.0001). There were parallel increases in total hip and trochanter bone mineral density. Calcitriol increased bone mineral density 0.10% (+/‐ 4.27%) at the femoral neck (P = 0.57) and 1.65% (+/‐ 4.83%) at the spine (P < 0.0124). The combination of hormone replacement therapy/estrogen replacement therapy + calcitriol increased bone mineral density 3.80% (+/‐4.95%) at the femoral neck (P < 0.001), 4.91% (+/‐6.0%) at the spine (P < 0.0001), and parallel changes at the total hip and trochanter. All three treatment groups differed significantly from placebo at the spine and for the hormone replacement therapy/estrogen replacement therapy groups at the femoral neck, spine, total hip and trochanter. There were no significant differences between combination therapy and hormone replacement therapy/estrogen replacement therapy alone on bone mineral density at any site in the intent to treat analysis. In a secondary analysis of the effect in women who were adherent to treatment, calcitriol had a more significant effect on spine (P = 0.003) and total hip (P = 0.004). The increase in bone mineral density in the adherent groups of women was always higher compared with the intent to treat groups. Combination therapy compared with hormone replacement therapy/estrogen replacement therapy alone produced a significantly greater response in trochanter (P = 0.007) and total hip bone mineral density (P = 0.0017). In summary, hormone replacement therapy/estrogen replacement therapy alone and in combination with calcitriol therapy was highly effective in reducing bone resorption and increasing bone mineral density at the hip and other clinically relevant sites in a group of elderly women, with normal bone density for their age. Calcitriol was effective in increasing spine bone mineral density. In the adherent women, combination therapy with hormone replacement therapy/estrogen replacement therapy and calcitriol increased bone mineral density significantly more in the total hip and trochanter than did hormone replacement therapy/estrogen replacement therapy alone.","86","8","3618‐3628","Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL)","PUBMED 11502787",,,,,"Journal article","Absorptiometry, Photon; Aged; Bone Density [drug effects]; Calcifediol [blood]; Calcitriol [*therapeutic use]; Calcium [blood, urine]; Calcium, Dietary; Double‐Blind Method; Drug Therapy, Combination; Estrogen Replacement Therapy; Female; Femur; Humans; Hysterectomy; Medroxyprogesterone Acetate [*therapeutic use]; Osteocalcin [blood]; Osteoporosis [blood, *prevention & control]; Osteoporosis, Postmenopausal [blood, *prevention & control]; Parathyroid Hormone [blood]; Placebos; Progesterone Congeners [therapeutic use]; Spine; Time Factors","10.1210/jcem.86.8.7703","https://www.cochranelibrary.com/central/doi/10.1002/central/CN-00350022/full","Musculoskeletal; Bone, Joint and Muscle Trauma; Kidney and Transplant; Heart; Metabolic and Endocrine Disorders"

The study protocol called for increasing the dose of 1,25‐(OH)2D3 until patients developed either hypercalcemia or hypercalciuria. However, in order to maintain a higher dose of calcitriol on a long‐term basis, the calcium intake had to be reduced to 600 mg/d in those receiving calcitriol; if that was not successful in eliminating hypercalcemia and hypercalciuria, then the dose of 1,25‐(OH)2D3 was reduced as necessary.

DESIGN: Two‐year, double‐blind, randomized clinical trial. SETTING: University medical center. PATIENTS: Fifty postmenopausal women with vertebral fractures recruited by referral. INTERVENTION: Calcium intake was adjusted to 25 mmol/d (1000 mg/d) at baseline. Patients were then randomized to treatment with either calcitriol or placebo. During the study, calcium intake was reduced to 15 mmol/d (600 mg/d) and the dose of calcitriol was adjusted to maintain serum calcium less than 2.74 mmol/L (less than 11.0 mg/dL) or urine calcium less than 9.96 mmol/d (less than 400 mg/d). MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: After 2 years, the mean dose of calcitriol in the treated group was 0.62 micrograms/d. Bone mineral density of the spine increased 1.94% with calcitriol therapy and decreased 3.92% with placebo (P = 0.001). Total body calcium increased 0.21% with calcitriol therapy and decreased 1.85% with placebo (P = 0.004). Patients receiving placebo had significant decreases in spine density (P = 0.0007) and total body calcium (P = 0.0004). There were no differences in vertebral fracture rates between the groups. Renal function studies were not statistically different between the groups after 2 years. CONCLUSION: The treatment of postmenopausal osteoporotic women with synthetic calcitriol for 2 years was associated with increases in spine density and total body calcium. No adverse effects on renal function were seen after long‐term calcitriol therapy.","113","9","649‐655","Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL)","PUBMED 2221645",,,,,"Journal article","Aged; Biopsy; Bone Density [drug effects]; Bone and Bones [pathology]; Calcitriol [*administration & dosage, therapeutic use]; Dose‐Response Relationship, Drug; Female; Fractures, Bone [epidemiology]; Humans; Incidence; Middle Aged; Osteoporosis, Postmenopausal [*drug therapy, metabolism, pathology]","10.7326/0003-4819-113-9-649","https://www.cochranelibrary.com/central/doi/10.1002/central/CN-00070699/full","Bone, Joint and Muscle Trauma"

DESIGN: Randomized, placebo‐controlled double‐blind, trial of 2 years' duration. SETTING: Multicenter study in 60 hostels (assisted living facilities) and 89 nursing homes across Australia. PARTICIPANTS: Six hundred twenty‐five residents (mean age 83.4) with serum 25‐hydroxyvitamin D levels between 25 and 90 nmol/L. INTERVENTION: Vitamin D supplementation (ergocalciferol, initially 10,000 IU given once weekly and then 1,000 IU daily) or placebo for 2 years. All subjects received 600 mg of elemental calcium daily as calcium carbonate. MEASUREMENTS: Falls and fractures recorded prospectively in study diaries by care staff. RESULTS: The vitamin D and placebo groups had similar baseline characteristics. In intention‐to‐treat analysis, the incident rate ratio for falling was 0.73 (95% confidence interval (CI)=0.57‐0.95).

Below a creatinine clearance (CrCl) of less than 65ml/min. plain vitamin D is not metabolized into its active muscle and neuronal sensitizing form Calcitriol, the D‐Hormone. Recent results in different populations showed that a CrCl of <65ml/min., as a surrogate for low D‐hormone serum levels, is associated with a significantly increased risk for falls and fallers. Since this hypothesis suggest that D‐hormone would be the only adequate treatment to prevent falls in elderly people with a CrCl of <65ml/min, we analyzed in such a population the effect of Alfacalcidol, a D‐hormone analogue, on number of falls and fallers. Material and Methods: In a population of 378 Swiss community‐dwelling women (N=191) and men (N=187), 70 years old and older, for 36 weeks randomly 191 received 1lg capsules of Alfacalcidol (AlphaD3 Teva), and 187 received one capsule of placebo daily. With the help of questionnaires we regularly assessed the incidence and frequency of falls. Using multivariatecontrolled logistic regression models we assessed the risk of becoming a faller and the risk of falling according to treatment groups and according to a CrCl cut off of 65ml/min. The presented results are from ITT analyses. Results: The 36 weeks of treatment with Alfacalcidol was, compared to placebo, in participants with a CrCl of <65 ml/ min., associated with a significant reduction in the number of fallers (14/72 vs. 25/70; OR 0.26, 95%CI 0.08‐0.80, p=0.019), and a significant reduction of the number of falls (16/72 vs. 28/70; OR 0.29, 95%CI 0.09‐0.88, p=0.028).

For the activation of calcitriol (D‐hormone) renal function is detrimental. We therefore determined the cutoff levels of creatinine clearance (CrCl), used as a marker of renal function, at which D‐hormone serum levels declines. Using the data of a double‐blind randomized study and the determined cutoff, we analyzed if CrCl is associated with the risk of falls and whether treatment with Alfacalcidol can reduce this risk. Methods: For 36 weeks randomly 378 community‐dwelling elderly men and women received 1lg Alfacalcidol (Alpha‐D3 TEVA) or placebo daily. Incidence and number of falls were regularly assessed with the help of a questionnaire. In multivariate‐controlled logistic regression models, we assessed, according to treatment groups and according to a CrCl cutoff at 65 ml/min, the risk to become a faller and the risk of falls. Presented results are from ITT analyses. Results: In multivariate‐controlled analyses D‐hormone serum levels were significantly associated with CrCl (p<0.0001) and steadily declined below a CrCl of 65 ml/min. In multivariate controlled analyses parameters associated with low D‐hormone serum levels were in order of significance: a CrCl of <65ml/min (p=0.0008), the use of diuretics (p=0.001) and a diagnosis of adult onset diabetes (p=0.003). In the Placebo group, we observed significantly more fallers in participants with a CrCl of <65ml/min compared to participants with a CrCl of ?65ml/min (OR 4.01, 95%CI 1.48‐10.98, p=0.006). 36 weeks of treatment with Alfacalcidol was in participants with a CrCl of <65ml/min, compared to placebo, associated with a significant reduction in the number of fallers (OR 0.26, 95%CI 0.08‐0.80, p=0.019), and a significant reduction of number of falls (OR 0.29, 95%CI 0.09‐0.88, p=0.028). No clinically relevant hypercalcemia were observed. Conclusion: A reduced CrCl of <65ml/min is, similarly to other risk factors (serum‐cytokines , glucocorticoid‐treatment), significantly associated with low D‐hormone and with a significant increased risk of falls. Treatment with Alfacalcidol significantly and safely reduces in a community‐dwelling elderly population with a CrCl of <65ml/min, the low CrCl associated increased number of fallers and the high risk of falls.","15","Suppl 1","S144‐5","Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL)",,,,,,"Journal article",,,"https://www.cochranelibrary.com/central/doi/10.1002/central/CN-01912859/full","Bone, Joint and Muscle Trauma"

DESIGN: Randomized, double‐blind, placebo‐controlled intervention trial. SETTING: Basel, Switzerland. PARTICIPANTS: Three hundred seventy‐eight community‐dwelling elderly (191 women/187 men). INTERVENTION: Participants were randomly assigned to receive 1 microg of alfacalcidol or matched placebo daily for 36 weeks. MEASUREMENTS: Serum 25‐hydoxyvitamin D3 (25(OH) D,1,25‐dihydroxyvitamin D3 (D‐hormone), and intact parathormone (iPTH) levels were measured using radioimmunoassay at baseline and every 12 weeks. Numbers of fallers and falls were assessed using a questionnaire during each study site visit. Dietary calcium intake was assessed at baseline using a food frequency questionnaire. RESULTS: At baseline, participants had, on average, normal vitamin D and D‐hormone serum levels. Over 36 weeks, alfacalcidol treatment was associated with fewer fallers (odds ratio (OR)=0.69, 95% confidence interval (CI)=0.41‐1.16) than placebo.

OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to determine whether intakes of different dietary fats are associated with the increase in serum 25‐hydroxyvitamin D (25OHD) after supplementation with vitamin D(3). DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This analysis was conducted in the active treatment arm of a randomized, double‐blind, placebo‐controlled trial of vitamin D and calcium supplementation to prevent bone loss and fracture. Subjects included 152 healthy men and women age 65 and older who were assigned to 700 IU/d vitamin D(3) and 500 mg/d calcium. Intakes of monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA), polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA), and saturated fatty acids (SFA) were estimated by food frequency questionnaire. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: The change in plasma 25OHD during 2 yr vitamin D and calcium supplementation was assessed. RESULTS: The change in plasma 25OHD (nanograms per milliliter) during vitamin D supplementation was positively associated with MUFA, (β = 0.94; P = 0.016), negatively associated with PUFA, (β = ‐0.93; P = 0.038), and positively associated with the MUFA/PUFA ratio (β = 6.46; P = 0.014). CONCLUSION: The fat composition of the diet may influence the 25OHD response to supplemental vitamin D(3). Diets rich in MUFA may improve and those rich in PUFA may reduce the effectiveness of vitamin D(3) supplements in healthy older adults.

SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Tooth loss was examined in 145 healthy subjects aged 65 years and older who completed a 3‐year, randomized, placebo‐controlled trial of the effect of calcium and vitamin D supplementation on bone loss from the hip, as well as a 2‐year follow‐up study after discontinuation of study supplements. Teeth were counted at 18 months and 5 years. A comprehensive oral examination at 5 years included assessment of caries, oral hygiene, and periodontal disease. The odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) of tooth loss were estimated by stepwise multivariate logistic regression. Initial age (mean +/‐ SD) of subjects was 71 +/‐ 5 years, and the number of teeth remaining was 22 +/‐ 7. RESULTS: During the randomized trial, 11 of the 82 subjects (13%) taking supplements and 17 of the 63 subjects (27%) taking placebo lost one or more teeth (OR = 0.4; 95% CI: 0.2 to 0.9). During the 2‐year follow‐up period, 31 of the 77 subjects (40%) with total calcium intake of at least 1000 mg per day lost one or more teeth compared with 40 of the 68 subjects (59%) who consumed less (OR = 0.5; 95% CI: 0.2 to 0.9). CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that intake levels of calcium and vitamin D aimed at preventing osteoporosis have a beneficial effect on tooth retention.","111","6","452‐456","Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL)","PUBMED 11690570",,,,,"Journal article","Aged; Bone Density [drug effects]; Calcium; Calcium, Dietary [*therapeutic use]; Cholecalciferol [*therapeutic use]; Citric Acid [*therapeutic use]; Dietary Supplements; Double‐Blind Method; Female; Femur Neck [diagnostic imaging]; Follow‐Up Studies; Humans; Malates [*therapeutic use]; Male; Odds Ratio; Oral Health; Oral Hygiene; Osteoporosis [*prevention & control]; Radiography; Tooth Loss [*prevention & control]; Tooth [drug effects]","10.1016/s0002-9343(01)00899-3","https://www.cochranelibrary.com/central/doi/10.1002/central/CN-00375038/full","Complementary Medicine; Bone, Joint and Muscle Trauma; Oral Health; Metabolic and Endocrine Disorders"

MATERIALS AND METHODS: A secondary analysis of a double blind randomized controlled trial was employed, which included 64 institutionalized elderly women with complete balance assessment (age range: 65‐97; mean 25‐hydroxyvitamin D levels: 16.4 ng/ml (SD +/‐9.9). Participants received 1,200 mg calcium plus 800 IU cholecalciferol (n=33) or 1,200 mg calcium (n=31) per day over a 3‐month treatment period. Using an electronic device attached to the lower back of the participant, balance was assessed as the degree of trunk angular displacement and angular velocity during a postural task (standing on two legs, eyes open, for 20 s) and a dynamic task (get up from a standard height chair with arm rests, sit down and then stand up again and remain standing). RESULTS: It was found that both postural and dynamic balance independently and significantly predicted the rate of falling within the 3‐month follow‐up. Vitamin D plus calcium reduced the rate of falls by 60% [relative risk (RR)=0.40; 95% CI: 0.17, 0.94] if compared with calcium alone. Once postural and dynamic balance were added to the regression analysis, they both attenuated the effect of vitamin D plus calcium on the rate of falls. For postural balance, the RR changed by 22% from 0.40 to 0.62 if angular displacement was added to the model, and by 9% from 0.40 to 0.49 if angular velocity was added. For dynamic balance, it changed by 1% from 0.40 to 0.41 if angular displacement was added, and by 14% from 0.40 to 0.54 if angular velocity was added. DISCUSSION: Thus, balance assessment using trunk angular displacement is a valid method for the prediction of falls in older women. Of the observed 60% reduction in the rate of falls by vitamin D plus calcium supplementation compared with calcium alone, up to 22% of the treatment effect was explained by a change in postural balance and up to 14% by dynamic balance.","17","5","656‐663","Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL)","PUBMED 16508700",,,,,"Journal article","Accidental Falls [*prevention & control]; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Calcium, Dietary [*therapeutic use]; Dietary Supplements; Double‐Blind Method; Female; Humans; Postural Balance [drug effects]; Switzerland; Vitamin D [*therapeutic use]","10.1007/s00198-005-0030-9","https://www.cochranelibrary.com/central/doi/10.1002/central/CN-00576018/full","Injuries; Bone, Joint and Muscle Trauma"

METHODS: We studied the effects of three years of dietary supplementation with calcium and vitamin D on bone mineral density, biochemical measures of bone metabolism, and the incidence of nonvertebral fractures in 176 men and 213 women 65 years of age or older who were living at home. They received either 500 mg of calcium plus 700 IU of vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol) per day or placebo. Bone mineral density was measured by dual‐energy x‐ray absorptiometry, blood and urine were analyzed every six months, and cases of nonvertebral fracture were ascertained by means of interviews and verified with use of hospital records. RESULTS: The mean (+/‐SD) changes in bone mineral density in the calcium‐vitamin D and placebo groups were as follows: femoral neck, +0.50+/‐4.80 and ‐0.70+/‐5.03 percent, respectively (P=0.02); spine,+2.12+/‐4.06 and +1.22+/‐4.25 percent (P=0.04); and total body, +0.06+/‐1.83 and ‐1.09+/‐1.71 percent (P<0.001). The difference between the calcium‐vitamin D and placebo groups was significant at all skeletal sites after one year, but it was significant only for total‐body bone mineral density in the second and third years. Of 37 subjects who had nonvertebral fractures, 26 were in the placebo group and 11 were in the calcium‐vitamin D group (P=0.02). CONCLUSIONS: In men and women 65 years of age or older who are living in the community, dietary supplementation with calcium and vitamin D moderately reduced bone loss measured in the femoral neck, spine, and total body over the three‐year study period and reduced the incidence of nonvertebral fractures.","337","10","670‐676","Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL)","PUBMED 9278463",,,,,"Journal article","Aged; Bone Density [*drug effects]; Calcium [blood, pharmacology, *therapeutic use]; Citric Acid [pharmacology, *therapeutic use]; Collagen Type I; Collagen [urine]; Double‐Blind Method; Female; Femur Neck [drug effects]; Fractures, Bone [epidemiology, *prevention & control]; Humans; Incidence; Malates [pharmacology, *therapeutic use]; Male; Osteocalcin [blood]; Peptides [urine]; Risk; Spine [drug effects]; Vitamin D [blood, pharmacology, *therapeutic use]","10.1056/NEJM199709043371003","https://www.cochranelibrary.com/central/doi/10.1002/central/CN-00142693/full","Complementary Medicine; Musculoskeletal; Bone, Joint and Muscle Trauma; Metabolic and Endocrine Disorders"

Combined vitamin K with vitamin D plus calcium was associated with a modest but significant increase in BMC at the ultradistal radius but not at other sites in the hip or radius. INTRODUCTION: The putative beneficial role of high dietary vitamin K(1) (phylloquinone) on BMD and the possibility of interactive benefits with vitamin D were studied in a 2‐year double‐blind, placebo‐controlled trial in healthy Scottish women > or =60 years of age. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Healthy, nonosteoporotic women (n = 244) were randomized to receive either (1) placebo, (2) 200 microg/day vitamin K(1), (3) 10 microg (400 IU) vitamin D(3) plus 1000 mg calcium/day, or (4) combined vitamins K(1) and D(3) plus calcium. Baseline and 6‐month measurements included DXA bone mineral scans of the hip and wrist, markers of bone turnover, and vitamin status. Supplementation effects were tested using multivariate general linear modeling, with full adjustment for baseline and potential confounding variables. RESULTS: Significant bone mineral loss was seen only at the mid‐distal radius but with no significant difference between groups. However, women who took combined vitamin K and vitamin D plus calcium showed a significant and sustained increase in both BMD and BMC at the site of the ultradistal radius. Serum status indicators responded significantly to respective supplementation with vitamins K and D. Over 2 years, serum vitamin K(1) increased by 157% (p < 0.001), the percentage of undercarboxylated osteocalcin (%GluOC) decreased by 51% (p < 0.001), serum 25‐hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] increased by 17% (p < 0.001), and PTH decreased by 11% (p = 0.049). CONCLUSIONS: These results provide evidence of a modest synergy in healthy older women from nutritionally relevant intakes of vitamin K(1) together with supplements of calcium plus moderate vitamin D(3) to enhance BMC at the ultradistal radius, a site consisting of principally trabecular bone. The substantial increase in gamma‐carboxylation of osteocalcin by vitamin K may have long‐term benefits and is potentially achievable by increased dietary intakes of vitamin K rather than by supplementation.","22","4","509‐519","Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL)","PUBMED 17243866","EMBASE 47457427",,,,"Journal article","Absorptiometry, Photon; Aged; Bone Density [*drug effects]; Calcifediol [blood]; Calcium, Dietary [*administration & dosage]; Cholecalciferol [*administration & dosage]; Double‐Blind Method; Drug Synergism; Drug Therapy, Combination; Female; Humans; Middle Aged; Osteocalcin [chemistry, metabolism]; Pelvic Bones [drug effects, metabolism]; Radius [drug effects, metabolism]; Vitamin K 1 [*administration & dosage, blood]","10.1359/jbmr.070116","https://www.cochranelibrary.com/central/doi/10.1002/central/CN-00577913/full","Bone, Joint and Muscle Trauma; Metabolic and Endocrine Disorders; Complementary Medicine"

Cross‐sectional studies show that elderly persons with higher vitamin D serum levels have increased muscle strength and a lower number of falls. We hypothesized that vitamin D and calcium supplementation would improve musculoskeletal function and decrease falls. In a double‐blind randomized controlled trial, we studied 122 elderly women (mean age, 85.3 years; range, 63‐99 years) in long‐stay geriatric care. Participants received 1200 mg calcium plus 800 IU cholecalciferol (Cal+D‐group; n = 62) or 1200 mg calcium (Cal‐group; n = 60) per day over a 12‐week treatment period. The number of falls per person (0, 1, 2‐5, 6‐7, >7 falls) was compared between the treatment groups. In an intention to treat analysis, a Poisson regression model was used to compare falls after controlling for age, number of falls in a 6‐week pretreatment period, and baseline 25‐hydroxyvitamin D and 1,25‐dihydroxyvitamin D serum concentrations. Among fallers in the treatment period, crude excessive fall rate (treatment ‐ pretreatment falls) was compared between treatment groups. Change in musculoskeletal function (summed score of knee flexor and extensor strength, grip strength, and the timed up&go test) was measured as a secondary outcome. Among subjects in the Cal+D‐group, there were significant increases in median serum 25‐hydroxyvitamin D (+71%) and 1,25‐dihydroxyvitamin D (+8%). Before treatment, mean observed number of falls per person per week was 0.059 in the Cal+D‐group and 0.056 in the Cal‐group. In the 12‐week treatment period, mean number of falls per person per week was 0.034 in the Cal+D‐group and 0.076 in the Cal‐group. After adjustment, Cal+D‐treatment accounted for a 49% reduction of falls (95% CI, 14‐71%; p < 0.01) based on the fall categories stated above. Among fallers of the treatment period, the crude average number of excessive falls was significantly higher in the Cal‐group (p = 0.045). Musculoskeletal function improved significantly in the Cal+D‐group (p = 0.0094). A single intervention with vitamin D plus calcium over a 3‐month period reduced the risk of falling by 49% compared with calcium alone. Over this short‐term intervention, recurrent fallers seem to benefit most by the treatment. The impact of vitamin D on falls might be explained by the observed improvement in musculoskeletal function.","18","2","343‐351","Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL)","PUBMED 12568412",,,,,"Journal article","Accidental Falls [*prevention & control]; Age Factors; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Bone and Bones [metabolism]; Calcifediol [metabolism]; Calcium [metabolism, *pharmacology]; Dietary Supplements; Double‐Blind Method; Female; Fractures, Bone [*prevention & control]; Humans; Middle Aged; Muscles [metabolism]; Poisson Distribution; Time Factors; Vitamin D [metabolism, *pharmacology]","10.1359/jbmr.2003.18.2.343","https://www.cochranelibrary.com/central/doi/10.1002/central/CN-00432180/full","Complementary Medicine; Bone, Joint and Muscle Trauma; Metabolic and Endocrine Disorders"

Methods: A multicentre, prospective, randomised, doubleblind, parallel‐group, 2‐year placebo‐controlled study. Efficacy was assessed by estimation of HF risk ratio and from BMD at femoral neck and distal radius, measured with dual/single‐energy X‐ray‐absorptiometry, respectively. Serum intact parathyroid hormone (iPTH), 25 hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D], bone alkaline phosphatase, calcium and phosphate were also measured. Results: The intention‐to‐treat population [583 ambulatory institutionalised women (mean age 85.2 years, SD = 7.1)] was randomised to three arms: calcium plus vitamin D3 fixed combination group (199); calcium plus vitamin D3 separate combination group (190) and placebo group (194). The relative risk (RR) of HF in the placebo group compared to the active treatment group was 1.69 (95% CI = [0.96, 3.0]), which is similar to that found in Decalyos I (RR = 1.7; 95% CI = [1.0, 2.8]). The cumulative probability curve for HF started to deviate about 9 months after initiation of the trial. In a subgroup (114 patients), femoral neck BMD decreased in the placebo group (mean =72.36% per year, SD = 4.92), while remaining unchanged in women receiving active treatment (mean = 0.29% per year, SD = 8.63). The difference between the two groups was 2.65% (95% CI = [‐0.44, 5.75%]) with a trend in favour of the active treatment group. Both active regimens had similar biochemical effects with increased serum 25(OH)D and decreased serum iPTH. Conclusion: These data are in agreement with those of Decalyos I: calcium and vitamin D3 combined supplementation can 1) reverse senile secondary hyperparathyroidism, 2) reduce hip bone loss and the risk of HF in elderly institutionalised women.","13","Suppl 1","S25","Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL)",,,,,,"Journal article",,,"https://www.cochranelibrary.com/central/doi/10.1002/central/CN-01702556/full","Bone, Joint and Muscle Trauma; Complementary Medicine"

OBJECTIVE: The objective of the present study was to determine whether supplemental calcium citrate malate and vitamin D influence any associations between protein intake and change in bone mineral density (BMD). DESIGN: Associations between protein intake and change in BMD were examined in 342 healthy men and women (aged > or = 65 y) who had completed a 3‐y, randomized, placebo‐controlled trial of calcium and vitamin D supplementation. Protein intake was assessed at the midpoint of the study with the use of a food‐frequency questionnaire and BMD was assessed every 6 mo by dual‐energy X‐ray absorptiometry. RESULTS: The mean (+/‐SD) protein intake of all subjects was 79.1 +/‐ 25.6 g/d and the mean total calcium intakes of the supplemented and placebo groups were 1346 +/‐ 358 and 871 +/‐ 413 mg/d, respectively. Higher protein intake was significantly associated with a favorable 3‐y change in total‐body BMD in the supplemented group (in a model containing terms for age, sex, weight, total energy intake, and dietary calcium intake) but not in the placebo group. The pattern of change in femoral neck BMD with increasing protein intake in the supplemented group was similar to that for the total body. CONCLUSION: Increasing protein intake may have a favorable effect on change in BMD in elderly subjects supplemented with calcium citrate malate and vitamin D.","75","4","773‐779","Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL)","PUBMED 11916767",,,,,"Journal article","Absorptiometry, Photon; Aged; Bone Density [*drug effects]; Calcium [administration & dosage, *adverse effects]; Diet; Dietary Proteins [*administration & dosage, pharmacology]; Energy Intake; Female; Humans; Male; Vitamin D [*pharmacology]","10.1093/ajcn/75.4.773","https://www.cochranelibrary.com/central/doi/10.1002/central/CN-00379085/full","Bone, Joint and Muscle Trauma; Complementary Medicine"

Control patients (n = 6) received ergocalciferol (50,000 units twice a week) and 1 g of supplemental calcium. Bone biopsies and CT‐determined bone mineral density were done initially and after 1 year of therapy. Bone mineral density increased from 77 +/‐ 18 to 88 +/‐ 9 mg/ml (NS) in the calcitriol‐treated group and from 87 +/‐ 13 to 112 +/‐ 30 mg/ml (NS) in the ergocalciferol‐treated group. There was also no significant change in bone volume, as determined by bone biopsy in either group. No compression fractures occurred in either treatment group. After 1 year of therapy, urinary calcium excretion was increased significantly above that observed in age‐matched untreated women. Creatinine clearance did not change significantly. Hypercalcemia was rare. In summary, we found calcitriol was not superior to ergocalciferol in preventing progressive bone loss and fractures. Both therapies were associated with significant hypercalciuria.","16","6","385‐390","Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL)","PUBMED 2089252",,,,,"Journal article","Bone Density; Bone Diseases, Metabolic [*drug therapy]; Calcitriol [*administration & dosage, therapeutic use]; Calcium [administration & dosage, *therapeutic use, urine]; Creatinine [blood, urine]; Drug Therapy, Combination; Ergocalciferols [therapeutic use]; Female; Humans; Middle Aged; Vitamin D [therapeutic use]",,"https://www.cochranelibrary.com/central/doi/10.1002/central/CN-00074854/full","Bone, Joint and Muscle Trauma"

Calcium and vitamin D supplements can reverse secondary hyperparathyroidism thus preventing hip fractures, as proved by Decalyos I. Decalyos II is a 2‐year, multicenter, randomized, double‐masked, placebo‐controlled confirmatory study. The intention‐to‐treat population consisted of 583 ambulatory institutionalized women (mean age 85.2 years, SD = 7.1) randomized to the calcium‐vitamin D3 fixed combination group (n = 199); the calcium plus vitamin D3 separate combination group (n = 190) and the placebo group (n = 194). Fixed and separate combination groups received the same daily amount of calcium (1200 mg) and vitamin D3 (800 IU), which had similar pharmacodynamic effects. Both types of calcium‐vitamin D3 regimens increased serum 25‐hydroxyvitamin D and decreased serum intact parathyroid hormone to a similar extent, with levels returning within the normal range after 6 months. In a subgroup of 114 patients, femoral neck bone mineral density (BMD) decreased in the placebo group (mean = ‐2.36% per year, SD = 4.92), while remaining unchanged in women treated with calcium‐vitamin D3 (mean = 0.29% per year, SD = 8.63). The difference between the two groups was 2.65% (95% CI = ‐0.44, 5.75%) with a trend in favor of the active treatment group. No significant difference between groups was found for changes in distal radius BMD and quantitative ultrasonic parameters at the os calcis. The relative risk (RR) of HF in the placebo group compared with the active treatment group was 1.69 (95% CI = 0.96, 3.0), which is similar to that found in Decalyos I (RR = 1.7; 95% CI = 1.0, 2.8). Thus, these data are in agreement with those of Decalyos I and indicate that calcium and vitamin D3 in combination reverse senile secondary hyperparathyroidism and reduce both hip bone loss and the risk of hip fracture in elderly institutionalized women.","13","3","257‐264","Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL)","PUBMED 11991447",,,,,"Journal article","Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Analysis of Variance; Bone Density [drug effects]; Calcium [*therapeutic use]; Cholecalciferol [*therapeutic use]; Drug Therapy, Combination; Female; Femur Neck [physiopathology]; Hip Fractures [physiopathology, *prevention & control]; Homes for the Aged; Humans; Hyperparathyroidism, Secondary [physiopathology, *prevention & control]; Institutionalization; Middle Aged; Radius [diagnostic imaging]; Risk; Ultrasonography","10.1007/s001980200023","https://www.cochranelibrary.com/central/doi/10.1002/central/CN-00379937/full","Complementary Medicine; Bone, Joint and Muscle Trauma; Kidney and Transplant; Metabolic and Endocrine Disorders"

Adjustment was made in dietary calcium to maximize the dose of calcitriol. The study was completed by 15 patients who received placebo and 12 patients who received calcitriol. The calcitriol group had positive slopes (compared with negative slopes for the placebo group) for total body calcium, bone mineral content of the radius, bone mineral density of the lumbar spine, and radiographic absorptiometry of the middle phalanges. The difference between the two groups was statistically significant for each of these measurements. The fracture rate in the treatment group was 250 per 1,000 patient‐years as compared with 333 for the placebo group. The mean dose of calcitriol was 0.8 micrograms per day. Hypercalcemia, hypercalciuria, and perhaps nephrolithiasis were observed as complications of treatment. Calcitriol increased bone mineral density by decreasing bone resorption, but not by increasing bone formation. Future studies should concentrate on treatment with oral calcitriol in lower doses. It would also be of interest to examine parenteral administration of calcitriol. It is possible that bone formation can be increased by achieving higher serum levels of the drug, whereas complications may be avoided by using a non‐oral route of administration.","84","3 Pt 1","401‐408","Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL)","PUBMED 3279769",,,,,"Journal article","Aged; Bone Resorption [drug effects]; Bone and Bones [metabolism]; Calcitriol [administration & dosage, *therapeutic use]; Calcium, Dietary [administration & dosage]; Clinical Trials as Topic; Double‐Blind Method; Female; Humans; Intestinal Absorption [drug effects]; Menopause; Middle Aged; Minerals [metabolism]; Osteoporosis [*drug therapy]; Random Allocation; Time Factors","10.1016/0002-9343(88)90259-8","https://www.cochranelibrary.com/central/doi/10.1002/central/CN-00052757/full","Bone, Joint and Muscle Trauma"

OBJECTIVE: The objective was to determine whether gains in bone mineral density (BMD) induced by calcium and vitamin D supplementation persist after supplement withdrawal. DESIGN: Two‐hundred ninety‐five healthy, elderly men and women (aged >/=68 y) who had completed a 3‐y randomized, placebo‐controlled trial of calcium and vitamin D supplementation were followed for an additional 2 y during which no study supplements were given. BMD was measured by dual‐energy X‐ray absorptiometry, and biochemical variables related to calcium metabolism and bone turnover were measured. RESULTS: In the 128 men, supplement‐induced increases in spinal and femoral neck BMD were lost within 2 y of supplement discontinuation, but small benefits in total‐body BMD remained. In the 167 women, there were no lasting benefits in total‐body BMD or at any bone site. Consistent with the observations on BMD, the bone turnover rates in both men and women (as measured by serum osteocalcin concentrations) returned to their original higher concentrations within the same 2‐y period. CONCLUSION: Discontinued calcium and vitamin D supplementation has limited cumulative effect on bone mass in men and women aged >/=68 y.","72","3","745‐750","Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL)","PUBMED 10966893",,,,,"Journal article","Absorptiometry, Photon; Aged; Bone Density [*drug effects]; Bone Remodeling; Calcium [*administration & dosage, therapeutic use]; Female; Femur Neck [drug effects]; Follow‐Up Studies; Fractures, Bone [prevention & control]; Humans; Male; Osmolar Concentration; Osteocalcin [blood]; Spine [drug effects]; Vitamin D [*administration & dosage, therapeutic use]","10.1093/ajcn/72.3.745","https://www.cochranelibrary.com/central/doi/10.1002/central/CN-00299324/full","Complementary Medicine; Bone, Joint and Muscle Trauma; Metabolic and Endocrine Disorders"

A randomised controlled trial","Age and ageing","2007","BACKGROUND: Vitamin D deficiency is common in older people and may increase risk of falls and fracture. Hospital inpatients are at particular risk of falling. Previous studies suggest that vitamin D improves neuromuscular function and reduces falls. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether routine supplementation with vitamin D plus calcium reduces numbers of fallers and falls in a cohort of hospital admissions while they are inpatients. DESIGN: Randomised, double‐blind, controlled study. Participants: two hundred and five acute admissions >65 years to a geriatric medical unit. METHODS: Patients were randomised to intervention of daily vitamin D 800 iu plus calcium 1,200 mg or control group of daily calcium 1,200 mg, until discharge or death. RESULTS: Baseline characteristics were similar in both groups with a median age 84 years and a median length of stay = 30 days (IQR 14.75‐71.00). In a pre‐selected sub‐group (54/205 participants), median admission vitamin D level = 22.00 nmol/l (IQR 15.00‐30.50). This did not significantly increase in the treatment versus control group. Median study drug adherence = 88%, with no significant difference between study groups (Mann‐Whitney: P = 0.711). Although there were fewer fallers in the vitamin D cohort, this did not reach statistical significance (vitamin D: calcium = 36:45 fallers; RR 0.82 (CI 0.59‐1.16). Neither the mean number of falls (vitamin D: calcium = 1.040:1.155; Mann‐Whitney P = 0.435) or time to first fall (Log‐rank test P = 0.377) differed between groups. CONCLUSIONS: In a population of geriatric hospital inpatients, vitamin D did not reduce the number of fallers. Routine supplementation cannot be recommended to reduce falls in this group.","36","5","507‐513","Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL)","PUBMED 17656420","EMBASE 47554939",,,,"Journal article","*calcium carbonate/cb [Drug Combination]; *calcium carbonate/ct [Clinical Trial]; *colecalciferol/cb [Drug Combination]; *colecalciferol/ct [Clinical Trial]; *fall risk assessment; *vitamin supplementation; Accident prevention; Accidental Falls [*prevention & control]; Aged; Article; Calcium [administration & dosage]; Clinical trial; Cohort Studies; Cohort analysis; Controlled clinical trial; Controlled study; Death; Double blind procedure; Double‐Blind Method; Falling; Female; Fracture/pc [Prevention]; Hospital admission; Hospital patient; Human; Humans; Inpatients; Length of stay; Log rank test; Major clinical study; Male; Monotherapy; Patient Compliance; Patient compliance; Priority journal; Prospective Studies; Randomized controlled trial; Rank sum test; Risk reduction; Statistical significance; Vitamin D Deficiency [physiopathology]; Vitamin D [*administration & dosage]","10.1093/ageing/afm087","https://www.cochranelibrary.com/central/doi/10.1002/central/CN-00618628/full","Injuries; Bone, Joint and Muscle Trauma; SR-REHAB; Metabolic and Endocrine Disorders"

However, little is known about whether supplemental cholecalciferol plus calcium citrate malate will lower the long‐term risk of falling in men, active older individuals, and older individuals with higher 25‐hydroxyvitamin D levels. METHODS: We studied the effect of 3‐year supplementation with cholecalciferol‐calcium on the risk of falling at least once in 199 men and 246 women 65 years or older and living at home. Individuals received 700 IU of cholecalciferol plus 500 mg of calcium citrate malate per day or placebo in a randomized double‐blind manner. Subjects were classified as less physically active if physical activity was below the median level. Low 25‐hydroxyvitamin D levels were classified as those below 32 ng/mL (<80 nmol/L). RESULTS: In 3 years, 55% of women and 45% of men reported at least 1 fall. Mean +/‐ SD baseline 25‐hydroxyvitamin D levels were 26.6 +/‐ 12.7 ng/mL (66.4 +/‐ 31.7 nmol/L) in women and 33.2 +/‐ 14.2 ng/mL (82.9 +/‐ 34.9) in men. Cholecalciferol‐calcium significantly reduced the odds of falling in women (odds ratio [OR], 0.54; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.30‐0.97), but not in men (OR, 0.93; 95% CI, 0.50‐1.72). Fall reduction was most pronounced in less active women (OR, 0.35; 95% CI, 0.15‐0.81). Baseline 25‐hydroxyvitamin D level did not modulate the treatment effect. CONCLUSIONS: Long‐term dietary cholecalciferol‐calcium supplementation reduces the odds of falling in ambulatory older women by 46%, and especially in less active women by 65%. Supplementation had a neutral effect in men independent of their physical activity level.","166","4","424‐430","Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL)","PUBMED 16505262","EMBASE 43313646",,,,"Journal article","Accidental Falls [*prevention & control]; Aged; Calcium [*therapeutic use]; Cholecalciferol [*therapeutic use]; Drug Therapy, Combination; Female; Follow‐Up Studies; Humans; Male; Risk Factors; Time Factors; Vitamins [therapeutic use]","10.1001/archinte.166.4.424","https://www.cochranelibrary.com/central/doi/10.1002/central/CN-00555428/full","Bone, Joint and Muscle Trauma; Metabolic and Endocrine Disorders"

PURPOSE: We assessed the effects of an open trial design (no placebo and people know what tablets they are given) compared with a blinded, placebo‐controlled design on recruitment, compliance and retention within a randomized trial of secondary osteoporotic fracture prevention. METHODS: We undertook a randomized controlled comparison nested within a placebo‐controlled trial of nutritional supplementation amongst people aged 70 years or over who had previously sustained a fracture, recruited in a UK teaching hospital. Randomization was 2:1 in favour of the blinded, placebo‐controlled trial design. RESULTS: From 180 eligible participants randomized to receive information based on the open trial design, 134 (74.4%) consented to take part, compared with 233 (65.1%) of 358 people randomized to the blinded, placebo‐controlled design (difference 9.4%, 95% confidence interval 1.3‐17.4%). Reluctance to take a placebo and the desire to know tablet allocation were reasons given for not taking part in the blinded, placebo‐controlled design. There was no significant difference in tablet compliance. Open trial participants were more likely to remain in the trial for one year (difference 13.9%, 95% confidence interval 3.1‐24.6%), mainly reflecting the high retention of the open trial no tablet group compared to the open trial tablet group (difference 23.6%, 95% confidence interval 11.9‐35.2%). The odds ratio for reporting an adverse event in the open trial compared to the blinded, placebo‐controlled design was 0.64 (95% confidence interval 0.28‐1.49), and for reporting a fracture was 0.81 (0.36‐1.85). CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that using an open trial design may enhance participant recruitment and retention and thus improve generalizability and statistical power, but withdrawal rates may differ between the study allocations and may threaten the internal validity of the trial.","1","6","490‐498","Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL)","PUBMED 16279289",,,,,"Journal article","Aged; Bone Density Conservation Agents [therapeutic use]; Calcium [therapeutic use]; Dietary Supplements; Double‐Blind Method; Female; Fractures, Spontaneous [etiology, *prevention & control]; Humans; Male; Osteoporosis [*complications]; Patient Compliance; Patient Dropouts; Patient Selection; Refusal to Participate; Research Design; Vitamin D [therapeutic use]","10.1191/1740774504cn053oa","https://www.cochranelibrary.com/central/doi/10.1002/central/CN-00531826/full","HS-HANDSRCH; Complementary Medicine; Bone, Joint and Muscle Trauma; Metabolic and Endocrine Disorders"
