METHODS: One hundred and thirteen patients who were receiving a stable dose of risperidone were randomly assigned to either adjunctive aripiprazole treatment (10 mg/day) (aripiprazole group) or no additional treatment (control group) at a 1:1 ratio for 8 weeks. Schizophrenia symptoms were measured using the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS). Rating scales and safety assessments (RSESE, BARS, UKU) were performed at baseline and at weeks 4 and 8. Serum levels of prolactin were determined at baseline and at weeks 2, 4, 6 and 8. Metabolic parameters were determined at baseline and again at weeks 4 and 8. RESULTS: One hundred and thirteen patients were enrolled in this study, and 107 patients completed the study (54 in the aripiprazole group, and 53 in the control group). PANSS‐total scores in the aripiprazole group decreased significantly at week 4 (P = 0.003) and week 8 (P = 0.007) compared with the control group. PANSS‐negative scores in the aripiprazole group also decreased significantly at week 4 (P = 0.005) and week 8 (P< 0.001) compared with the control group. Serum levels of prolactin in the aripiprazole group decreased significantly at week 2 (P< 0.001), week 4 (P< 0.001), week 6 (P< 0.001) and week 8 (P< 0.001) compared with the control group. There were no significant differences in changes of Fasting Plasma Glucose, Total cholesterol, Triglycerides and High Density Lipoprotein within each group at week 4 and 8 execpt low density lipoproteins. There was no significant difference in the incidence of adverse reactions between the two groups. CONCLUSIONS: Adjunctive aripiprazole treatment may be beneficial in reducing serum levels of prolactin and improving negative symptoms in schizophrenia patients with risperidone‐induced hyperprolactinemia.

OBJECTIVE: The present study examined the efficacy and metabolic influence of paliperidone ER, aripiprazole and ziprasidone in patients with first‐episode schizophrenia in China. METHODS: Subjects were recruited from outpatient and 254 patients entered the trial. These patients received treatment randomly with paliperidone ER, aripiprazole and ziprasidone and were assessed at baseline, 13, 26 and 52 weeks, respectively with Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS), 7‐item Clinical Global Impressions‐Severity (CGI‐S), anthropometric (weight, body mass index and waist circumference) and metabolic (fasting blood glucose, HbA1c, cholesterol, high density lipoproteins (HDL), low density lipoproteins and triglycerides) measures. RESULTS: A total of 203 patients completed the trial. Paliperidone group had significant greater reduction in PANSS than aripiprazole group and ziprasidone group from 13 weeks, although the a reduction in PANSS of each group was more than 20%. There was no difference in CGI‐S among the three groups, and all three groups had a significant reduction from baseline in CGI‐S. Aripiprazole group increased in weight and body mass index despite no statistical change in waist circumference. Other two groups showed no changes in anthropometric measure. At the end of the study, two glucose metabolic indices (fasting blood glucose and HbA1c) of aripiprazole group were significantly higher than that of baseline. In lipid metabolism, aripiprazole group reduced triglycerides significantly and had no changes in other indices. Paliperidone group reduced HDL and increased triglycerides despite no changes in glucose metabolism. Ziprasidone group also had no significant changes in glucose metabolism, but reduced cholesterol, low density lipoproteins and increased HDL. Furthermore, 22 subjects in three groups reached the diagnostic criteria of metabolic syndrome. CONCLUSIONS: Paliperidone ER, aripiprazole and ziprasidone are effective in treating first‐episode schizophrenia, and the ranking of efficacy from high to low is paliperidone ER > aripiprazole > ziprasidone. Paliperidone ER can impair lipid metabolism potentially but had no influence on glucose metabolism. Aripiprazole can damage glucose metabolism and has little influence on lipid metabolism. Ziprasidone is considered an atypical antipsychotic with no evidence of harm to glucose and lipid metabolism.","27","6","605‐614","Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL)","PUBMED 24446539",,,,,"Journal article","Adult; Antipsychotic Agents [adverse effects, *therapeutic use]; Aripiprazole; Body Mass Index; China; Delayed‐Action Preparations [therapeutic use]; Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders; Female; Follow‐Up Studies; Humans; Hyperglycemia [chemically induced]; Hyperlipidemias [chemically induced]; Isoxazoles [adverse effects, *therapeutic use]; Male; Metabolic Diseases [*chemically induced]; Paliperidone Palmitate; Piperazines [adverse effects, *therapeutic use]; Psychiatric Status Rating Scales; Pyrimidines [adverse effects, *therapeutic use]; Quinolones [adverse effects, *therapeutic use]; Schizophrenia [blood, *drug therapy]; Thiazoles [adverse effects, *therapeutic use]; Weight Gain [drug effects]; Young Adult","10.1002/hup.2270","https://www.cochranelibrary.com/central/doi/10.1002/central/CN-00962365/full",

OBJECTIVE: To test the efficacy of lifestyle intervention and metformin alone and in combination for antipsychotic‐induced weight gain and abnormalities in insulin sensitivity. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PATIENTS: A randomized controlled trial (October 2004‐December 2006) involving 128 adult patients with schizophrenia in the Mental Health Institute of the Second Xiangya Hospital, Central South University, China. Participants who gained more than 10% of their predrug weight were assigned to 1 of 4 treatment groups. INTERVENTIONS: Patients continued their antipsychotic medication and were randomly assigned to 12 weeks of placebo, 750 mg/d of metformin alone, 750 mg/d of metformin and lifestyle intervention, or lifestyle intervention only. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Body mass index, waist circumference, insulin levels, and insulin resistance index. RESULTS: All 128 first‐episode schizophrenia patients maintained relatively stable psychiatric improvement. The lifestyle‐plus‐metformin group had mean decreases in body mass index (BMI) of 1.8 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.3‐2.3), insulin resistance index of 3.6 (95% CI, 2.7‐4.5), and waist circumference of 2.0 cm (95% CI, 1.5‐2.4 cm). The metformin‐alone group had mean decreases in BMI of 1.2 (95% CI, 0.9‐1.5), insulin resistance index of 3.5 (95% CI, 2.7‐4.4), and waist circumference of 1.3 cm (95% CI, 1.1‐1.5 cm). The lifestyle‐plus‐placebo group had mean decreases in BMI of 0.5 (95% CI, 0.3‐0.8) and insulin resistance index of 1.0 (95% CI, 0.5‐1.5). However, the placebo group had mean increases in BMI of 1.2 (95% CI, 0.9‐1.5), insulin resistance index of 0.4 (95% CI, 0.1‐0.7), and waist circumference of 2.2 cm (95% CI, 1.7‐2.8 cm). The lifestyle‐plus‐metformin treatment was significantly superior to metformin alone and to lifestyle plus placebo for weight, BMI, and waist circumference reduction. CONCLUSIONS: Lifestyle intervention and metformin alone and in combination demonstrated efficacy for antipsychotic‐induced weight gain. Lifestyle intervention plus metformin showed the best effect on weight loss. Metformin alone was more effective in weight loss and improving insulin sensitivity than lifestyle intervention alone.

METHOD: Forty patients with schizophrenia were randomly assigned to treatment for 12 weeks with olanzapine, 15 mg/day, plus metformin, 750 mg/day (N=20), or olanzapine, 15 mg/day, plus placebo (N=20). This investigation was conducted in a double‐blind fashion. Planned assessments included body weight, body mass index, proportion of patients who gained more than 7% of their baseline weight at the end of the 12‐week treatment, waist circumference, waist‐to‐hip ratio, fasting glucose and insulin, insulin resistance index, and scores on the Scale for the Assessment of Positive Symptoms (SAPS) and Scale for the Assessment of Negative Symptoms (SANS). RESULTS: Of the 40 patients who were randomly assigned, 37 (92.5%) completed treatments. The weight, body mass index, waist circumference, and waist‐to‐hip ratio levels increased less in the olanzapine plus metformin group relative to the olanzapine plus placebo group during the 12‐week follow‐up period. The insulin and insulin resistance index values of the olanzapine plus placebo group increased significantly at weeks 8 and 12. In contrast, the insulin and insulin resistance index levels of the olanzapine plus metformin group remained unchanged. Significantly fewer patients in the olanzapine plus metformin group relative to patients in the olanzapine plus placebo group increased their baseline weight by more than 7%, which was the cutoff for clinically meaningful weight gain. There was a significant decrease in SAPS and SANS scores within each group from baseline to week 12, with no between‐group differences. Metformin was tolerated well by all patients. CONCLUSIONS: Metformin was effective and safe in attenuating olanzapine‐induced weight gain and insulin resistance in drug‐naive first‐episode schizophrenia patients. Patients displayed good adherence to this type of preventive intervention.","165","3","352‐358","Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL)","PUBMED 18245179",,,,,"Journal article","Adolescent; Adult; Antipsychotic Agents [*adverse effects, therapeutic use]; Benzodiazepines [*adverse effects, therapeutic use]; Body Mass Index; Double‐Blind Method; Drug Administration Schedule; Drug Therapy, Combination; Follow‐Up Studies; Humans; Hypoglycemic Agents [administration & dosage, *therapeutic use]; Metformin [administration & dosage, *therapeutic use]; Middle Aged; Obesity [chemically induced, *prevention & control]; Olanzapine; Placebos; Psychiatric Status Rating Scales [statistics & numerical data]; Schizophrenia [diagnosis, *drug therapy]; Treatment Outcome; Waist‐Hip Ratio; Weight Gain [*drug effects]","10.1176/appi.ajp.2007.07010079","https://www.cochranelibrary.com/central/doi/10.1002/central/CN-00629793/full","Metabolic and Endocrine Disorders; Schizophrenia"

METHOD: One hundred twelve patients with schizophrenia were assigned randomly to receive clozapine, olanzapine, risperidone, or sulpiride for 8 weeks. Planned assessments included body mass index, waist‐hip ratio, fasting glucose, insulin, C‐peptide, insulin resistance index (IRI), cholesterol and triglyceride levels. All measures were collected at baseline and at the end of the 8‐week treatment. RESULTS: After treatment, waist‐hip ratio and triglyceride and IRI levels of men were increased higher than that of women in clozapine and olanzapine groups. In sulpiride group, body mass index and triglyceride, insulin, and IRI levels of women increased higher than those of men. There was no significant sex difference for all assessments in risperidone group. Insulin, C‐peptide, and IRI, but not fasting glucose levels, were significantly increased in the 4 groups. Cholesterol and triglyceride levels were significantly increased in the clozapine and olanzapine groups. Patients treated with clozapine and olanzapine had higher fasting insulin, C‐peptide, and IRI levels than those treated with risperidone and sulpiride. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that clozapine, olanzapine, and sulpiride had effects on glucose and lipid metabolism in first‐episode schizophrenia with sex difference.

Although there are many studies about the linkages between drugs and metabolic dysfunction, most of these studies have compared the effects of two antipsychotics on only one metabolic measure: either glucose or lipid metabolism. OBJECTIVES: The present study aimed to investigate the effects of clozapine, olanzapine, risperidone, and sulpiride on glucose and lipid metabolism in first‐episode schizophrenia. MATERIALS AND METHODS: One hundred twelve schizophrenics were assigned randomly to receive clozapine, olanzapine, risperidone, or sulpiride for 8 weeks. Planned assessments included body mass index (BMI), waist‐to‐hip ratio, fasting glucose, insulin, C‐peptide, insulin resistance index (IRI), cholesterol, and triglyceride. All measures were collected at baseline and at the end of the 8‐week treatment. RESULTS: After treatment, insulin, C‐peptide, and IRI were significantly increased in the four groups, but not fasting glucose levels. Cholesterol and triglyceride levels were significantly increased in the clozapine and olanzapine groups. Patients treated with clozapine and olanzapine had higher fasting insulin, C‐peptide, and IRI levels than those treated with risperidone and sulpiride. Among the four antipsychotics, the increases of mean BMI from high to low were as follows: clozapine, olanzapine, sulpiride, and risperidone. CONCLUSIONS: This study confirmed that the four antipsychotic drugs were associated with an increase of insulin, C‐peptide, and IRI. It was found that clozapine and olanzapine were associated with an increase in cholesterol and triglyceride levels. The effects of clozapine and olanzapine on the glucose and lipid metabolism outweighed those of risperidone and sulpiride.","186","4","572‐578","Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL)","PUBMED 16601995","EMBASE 43855844",,,,"Journal article","*atypical antipsychotic agent/ae [Adverse Drug Reaction]; *atypical antipsychotic agent/cm [Drug Comparison]; *atypical antipsychotic agent/ct [Clinical Trial]; *atypical antipsychotic agent/do [Drug Dose]; *atypical antipsychotic agent/dt [Drug Therapy]; *clozapine/ae [Adverse Drug Reaction]; *clozapine/cm [Drug Comparison]; *clozapine/ct [Clinical Trial]; *clozapine/do [Drug Dose]; *clozapine/dt [Drug Therapy]; *glucose homeostasis; *glucose metabolism; *lipid metabolism; *metabolic disorder/si [Side Effect]; *neuroleptic agent/ae [Adverse Drug Reaction]; *neuroleptic agent/cm [Drug Comparison]; *neuroleptic agent/ct [Clinical Trial]; *neuroleptic agent/do [Drug Dose]; *neuroleptic agent/dt [Drug Therapy]; *olanzapine/ae [Adverse Drug Reaction]; *olanzapine/cm [Drug Comparison]; *olanzapine/ct [Clinical Trial]; *olanzapine/do [Drug Dose]; *olanzapine/dt [Drug Therapy]; *risperidone/ae [Adverse Drug Reaction]; *risperidone/cm [Drug Comparison]; *risperidone/ct [Clinical Trial]; *risperidone/do [Drug Dose]; *risperidone/dt [Drug Therapy]; *schizophrenia/dt [Drug Therapy]; *sulpiride/ae [Adverse Drug Reaction]; *sulpiride/cm [Drug Comparison]; *sulpiride/ct [Clinical Trial]; *sulpiride/do [Drug Dose]; *sulpiride/dt [Drug Therapy]; Abnormally high substrate concentration in blood/si [Side Effect]; Adult; Antipsychotic Agents [*adverse effects]; Article; Benzodiazepines [adverse effects]; Blood Glucose [*drug effects]; Body Mass Index; Body mass; C peptide/ec [Endogenous Compound]; Cholesterol [blood]; Cholesterol blood level; Cholesterol/ec [Endogenous Compound]; Clinical trial; Clozapine [adverse effects]; Controlled clinical trial; Controlled study; C‐Peptide [blood]; Extrapyramidal syndrome/dt [Drug Therapy]; Extrapyramidal syndrome/si [Side Effect]; Female; Glucose/ec [Endogenous Compound]; Homeostasis [drug effects]; Human; Humans; Insulin Resistance; Insulin [*blood]; Insulin resistance; Insulin/ec [Endogenous Compound]; Lipid Metabolism [*drug effects]; Lorazepam; Major clinical study; Male; Metabolic Syndrome [blood, chemically induced, metabolism]; Olanzapine; Priority journal; Prospective Studies; Randomized controlled trial; Risperidone [adverse effects]; Schizophrenia [*blood, *drug therapy]; Sulpiride [adverse effects]; Triacylglycerol blood level; Triacylglycerol/ec [Endogenous Compound]; Triglycerides [blood]; Trihexyphenidyl/dt [Drug Therapy]; Waist hip ratio; Waist‐Hip Ratio","10.1007/s00213-006-0384-5","https://www.cochranelibrary.com/central/doi/10.1002/central/CN-00570384/full","Metabolic and Endocrine Disorders"

OBJECTIVE: This study was designed to assess whether vitamin D supplementation can reduce symptoms of depression, metabolic profiles, serum high‐sensitivity C‐reactive protein (hs‐CRP), and biomarkers of oxidative stress in patients with major depressive disorder (MDD). METHODS: This randomized, double‐blind, placebo‐controlled clinical trial was performed in 40 patients between 18 and 65 y of age with a diagnosis of MDD based on criteria from the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders. Patients were randomly assigned to receive either a single capsule of 50 kIU vitamin D/wk (n = 20) or placebo (n = 20) for 8 wk. Fasting blood samples were taken at baseline and postintervention to quantify relevant variables. The primary [Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), which examines depressive symptoms] and secondary (glucose homeostasis variables, lipid profiles, hs‐CRP, and biomarkers of oxidative stress) outcomes were assessed. RESULTS: Baseline concentrations of mean serum 25‐hydroxyvitamin D were significantly different between the 2 groups (9.2 ± 6.0 and 13.6 ± 7.9 μg/L in the placebo and control groups, respectively, P = 0.02). After 8 wk of intervention, changes in serum 25‐hydroxyvitamin D concentrations were significantly greater in the vitamin D group (+20.4 μg/L) than in the placebo group (‐0.9 μg/L, P < 0.001). A trend toward a greater decrease in the BDI was observed in the vitamin D group than in the placebo group (‐8.0 and ‐3.3, respectively, P = 0.06). Changes in serum insulin (‐3.6 compared with +2.9 μIU/mL, P = 0.02), estimated homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (‐1.0 compared with +0.6, P = 0.01), estimated homeostasis model assessment of β cell function (‐13.9 compared with +10.3, P = 0.03), plasma total antioxidant capacity (+63.1 compared with ‐23.4 mmol/L, P = 0.04), and glutathione (+170 compared with ‐213 μmol/L, P = 0.04) in the vitamin D group were significantly different from those in the placebo group.

Risk of depression is 10‐25% in women and 5‐12% in men. Since diabetes mellitus and its complications can lead to depression and vice versa, control of blood glucose levels in patients with depression and knowledge of the effect of antidepressant drugs on blood glucose levels are important. This study was performed to determine the effect of Fluoxetine and Imipramine on the fasting blood sugar (FBS) of patient with major depressive disorders. Material and Method: This study was a parallel randomized clinical trial based on diagnostic criteria of DSM‐IV‐TR. The subjects were selected randomly from the patients referring to Shahid Hashemi Senejani Hospital of Arak and private office. The patients were assigned into two groups; each group consisted of 40 subjects. Group A received fluoxetine 20 mg/day and group B received imipramine 100 mg/day. Measurement of FBS was performed before treatment, four weeks and eight weeks after treatment. Data were analyzed by means of descriptive statistics, KS (Kolmogorov‐Smirnov test) and paired t‐test. Results: There were no significant statistical differences between first and second times mean FBS values in groups A and B, but there were significant statistical differences in the third time mean FBS values between the two groups (P=0.001). Also there was not any significant difference in the first and second time mean FBS values in group A (P=0.424) too. A significant decrease in the first and third time mean FBS values was noticed (P =0.039). There was also a significant increase in the second and third times mean FBS values compared with the first time mean FBS values in group B (P<0.05) Conclusion: This study revealed a decrease in FBS mean values after 8 weeks of treatment with Fluoxetine and an increase in FBS after 4 and 8 weeks of treatment with Imipramine. Therefore, we recommend Fluoxetine for treatment of depression in the patients with hyperglycemia, and Imipramine for depression in the patients with hypoglycemia.","14","2","45‐51","Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL)",,"EMBASE 359846805",,,,"Journal article","*glucose blood level; *major depression /drug therapy /drug therapy; Article; Clinical article; Clinical trial; Controlled clinical trial; Controlled study; Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders; Drug effect; Human; Randomized controlled trial",,"https://www.cochranelibrary.com/central/doi/10.1002/central/CN-00803040/full","Common Mental Disorders"

METHODS: In this 6‐week, multicenter, open‐label trial, 260 patients were randomly assigned to receive ziprasidone or olanzapine treatment (130 per group). Primary metabolic measures were changes in weight and body mass index (BMI). Secondary metabolic measures were changes in glucose, insulin, lipids, and blood pressure. Efficacy and safety were also measured additionally. RESULTS: A total number of 230 patients completed the study. The mean daily dosages were 138.2(28.6) mg for ziprasidone and 19.0(2.3) mg for olanzapine. After 6‐week treatment, there were significant between‐group differences in change scores on weight [4.22(3.49) kg versus ‐0.84(2.04) kg, p < 0.001] and BMI [1.59(1.37) versus ‐0.30(0.74), p < 0.001]. In addition, there were significant between‐group differences in change scores on fasting plasma glucose, insulin, homeostasis model assessment 2‐insulin resistance, low‐density lipoprotein, total cholesterol, and triglycerides (p < 0.001); all the changes were clinically in favor of ziprasidone treatment. Both medications were effective in improving schizophrenia symptoms, but the decreases in Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale total scores of the olanzapine group were significantly greater than that of the ziprasidone group (p < 0.05). Compared with olanzapine, ziprasidone also induced more prolonging of corrected QT interval and extrapyramidal side effects (p < 0.05). Both medications were well tolerated, and no serious adverse events were observed in either group. CONCLUSIONS: Compared with olanzapine, ziprasidone treatment was associated with less adverse effects on glucose and lipid metabolism in patients with first‐episode schizophrenia.","225","3","627‐635","Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL)","PUBMED 22926006",,,,,"Journal article","Adolescent; Adult; Antipsychotic Agents [administration & dosage, *adverse effects, therapeutic use]; Benzodiazepines [administration & dosage, *adverse effects, therapeutic use]; Body Weight [drug effects]; Female; Glucose [metabolism]; Humans; Insulin [metabolism]; Lipid Metabolism [drug effects]; Male; Middle Aged; Olanzapine; Piperazines [administration & dosage, *adverse effects, therapeutic use]; Schizophrenia [*drug therapy, *metabolism]; Thiazoles [administration & dosage, *adverse effects, therapeutic use]; Young Adult","10.1007/s00213-012-2850-6","https://www.cochranelibrary.com/central/doi/10.1002/central/CN-00879140/full","Schizophrenia"

The purpose of this study was to assess the efficacy of topiramate to prevent olanzapine induced WG in these cases. We also studied various metabolic parameters. METHODS: In this 12‐week, double‐blind, parallel group study, seventy‐two drug‐naïve, first‐episode schizophrenia patients were randomized to receive olanzapine+placebo (olanzapine group) or olanzapine+topiramate (100mg/day) (topiramate group). Weight, body mass index, fasting glucose, insulin, insulin resistance (IR), leptin, lipids and blood pressure were assessed at baseline and at 12 weeks. The patients were clinically evaluated using Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) and were monitored for adverse effects. RESULTS: Topiramate resulted in a weight loss of 1.27+/‐2.28 kg (p<0.01), decrease in leptin (p<0.001), glucose, cholesterol, triglyceride levels and systolic and diastolic blood pressure. In the olanzapine group, there was a significant WG, hyperglycemia, hyperinsulinemia, increased IR, hyperleptinemia, hypercholesterolemia and hypertriglyceridemia (p<0.001).There was a greater clinical improvement (PANSS scores) (p<0.001) in the topiramate group. The adverse effects were well tolerated. CONCLUSIONS: Topiramate could prevent olanzapine induced weight gain and adverse metabolic effects.

Previous studies indicate that leptin plays no role in this change despite showing a strong correlation with body mass index (BMI) in healthy people. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of imipramine and fluoxetine on BMI and its correlation with leptin. Eighteen depressed female patients randomly received either drug for 3 months. BMI was calculated and fasting blood samples were assayed for glucose, leptin, insulin, free fatty acids (FFA), and lipids. The difference between the changes in BMI (imipramine + 1.0 kg/m2, fluoxetine ‐0.5 kg/m2) was statistically significant (P < 0.05, t = 2.106). There was a significant positive correlation between overall BMI and leptin (r = 0.784, P < 0.001) but not between BMI and insulin or FFA. However, fasting insulin levels and calculated insulin resistance levels dropped substantially in the imipramine group.

In a randomized double‐blind placebo‐controlled study, 48 patients with first‐episode schizophrenia who were eligible for olanzapine treatment, were randomly assigned to olanzapine plus either melatonin 3 mg/day or matched placebo for eight weeks. Anthropometric and metabolic parameters as well as psychiatric symptoms using The Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) were assessed at baseline, week 4, and 8. Primary outcome measure was the change from baseline in weight at week 8. Data were analyzed using t‐test, Mann‐Whitney U test, and mixed‐effects model. Thirty‐six patients had at least one post‐baseline measurement. At week eight, melatonin was associated with significantly less weight gain [mean difference (MD) = 3.2 kg, P = 0.023], increase in waist circumference [MD = 2.83 cm, P = 0.041] and triglyceride concentration [MD = 62 mg/dl, P = 0.090 (nearly significant)] than the placebo. Changes in cholesterol, insulin, and blood sugar concentrations did not differ significantly between the two groups. Patients in the melatonin group experienced significantly more reduction in their PANSS scores [MD = 12.9 points, P = 0.014] than the placebo group. No serious adverse events were reported. To summarize, in patients treated with olanzapine, short‐term melatonin treatment attenuates weight gain, abdominal obesity, and hypertriglyceridemia. It might also provide additional benefit for treatment of psychosis.

Sixty nondiabetic patients with major depressive disorder (based on Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition criteria) entered this randomized, double‐blind study. Patients did not receive any medication affecting serum FBG levels for at least 2 weeks before the initiation of the study. Patients were assigned to receive 20 to 40 mg/d of fluoxetine or 75 to 200 mg/d of imipramine for 8 weeks. Pregnant women and patients with diabetes mellitus and a history of any major heart disease were excluded from this study. Additionally, none of the patients should have received electroconvulsive therapy within 6 months before the initiation of the antidepressants. FBG levels were measured at the initiation, as well as 4 and 8 weeks after starting antidepressants. Nineteen patients in the fluoxetine and 24 patients in the imipramine groups completed the study.

METHODS: 66 patients diagnosed with schizophrenia who were on olanzapine treatment (5‐20 mg daily) were randomly allocated to receive a capsule of SAE (n=22; 30 mg daily), crocin (n=22; 30 mg daily) or placebo (n=22) in a 12‐week triple‐blind trial. Patients were screened not to have MetS at baseline and further assessment was done at weeks 6 and 12. Measurement of fasting blood glucose (FBS) and serum lipids were repeated at weeks 2, 6 and 12. Fasting blood levels of insulin and HbA1c were also measured at baseline and week 12. HOMA‐IR and HOMA‐β were determined to evaluate insulin resistance. RESULTS: 61 patients completed the trial and no serious adverse effects were reported. Time‐treatment interaction showed a significant difference in FBS in both SAE and crocin groups compared to placebo (p=0.004).

We evaluated the long‐term effects of a new‐generation antipsychotic, quetiapine and a conventional antipsychotic, haloperidol on body mass index (BMI) and glycaemic control in patients with schizophrenia previously treated with conventional antipsychotics. Forty‐five clinically stable patients with schizophrenia participated in this randomized, investigator‐blinded, parallel‐group comparison of flexible doses of quetiapine and haloperidol treatment over 52 wk. Primary outcome measures were change from baseline in BMI and glycosylated haemoglobin (HBA1c) levels. There were no between‐group differences at any of the time‐points for BMI (F = 1.90, p = 0.1) and HBA1c (F = 1.17, p = 0.3) values, and there were no significant changes in BMI from baseline for either group. HBA1c levels decreased significantly at end‐point for the haloperidol group (‐1.5%, p = 0.04), but not for the quetiapine group (‐0.3%, p = 0.5). Although the sample was not generally obese (mean baseline BMI 25.5 +/‐ 6.3 kg/m2), a large proportion exhibited evidence of abnormal glycaemic control prior to randomization (mean HBA1c 6.7 +/‐ 1.9%), with 48% having values that were at least mildly elevated (HBA1c > 6.1%) and 19% markedly elevated (HBA1c > 7%). The number of subjects with elevated HBA1c values decreased from baseline in both the haloperidol and quetiapine treatment groups. These findings suggest that switching treatment from a conventional antipsychotic to quetiapine is not associated with weight gain or worsening of glycaemic control, even in the long term. The study also highlights the high incidence of unrecognized glucose dysregulation in patients with schizophrenia receiving conventional antipsychotic treatment.","8","2","175‐182","Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL)","PUBMED 15737251","EMBASE 40769258",,,,"Journal article","*body mass; *glucose blood level; *haloperidol/ae [Adverse Drug Reaction]; *haloperidol/cm [Drug Comparison]; *haloperidol/ct [Clinical Trial]; *haloperidol/do [Drug Dose]; *haloperidol/dt [Drug Therapy]; *quetiapine/ae [Adverse Drug Reaction]; *quetiapine/cm [Drug Comparison]; *quetiapine/ct [Clinical Trial]; *quetiapine/do [Drug Dose]; *quetiapine/dt [Drug Therapy]; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Analysis of Variance; Antipsychotic Agents [*pharmacology, therapeutic use]; Article; Body Mass Index; Clinical article; Clinical trial; Controlled clinical trial; Controlled study; Dibenzothiazepines [*pharmacology, therapeutic use]; Double‐Blind Method; Drug substitution; Female; Glucose metabolism; Glycated Hemoglobin [metabolism]; Glycemic Index [*drug effects]; Glycosylated hemoglobin/ec [Endogenous Compound]; Haloperidol [*pharmacology, therapeutic use]; Hemoglobin A1c/ec [Endogenous Compound]; Human; Humans; Long term care; Longitudinal Studies; Male; Middle Aged; Outcomes research; Priority journal; Psychiatric Status Rating Scales; Quetiapine Fumarate; Randomized controlled trial; Schizophrenia [drug therapy]; Schizophrenia/dt [Drug Therapy]; Side effect/si [Side Effect]; Single blind procedure; Time Factors; Treatment Outcome; Weight gain","10.1017/S1461145705005067","https://www.cochranelibrary.com/central/doi/10.1002/central/CN-00560616/full","Metabolic and Endocrine Disorders; Schizophrenia"

However, studies examining selection of therapeutic drugs for this population are relatively few. OBJECTIVE: To examine the therapeutic efficacy and metabolic influence on blood‐glucose and serum lipid of ziprasidone in the treatment of elderly patients with first‐episode schizophrenia. METHODS: Using randomized grouping, 38 elderly patients with first‐episode schizophrenia were randomly divided into the ziprasidone treatment group (i.e. the study group) and the olanzapine treatment group (i.e. the control group), with 19 cases in either group respectively. The positive and negative symptoms scale (PANSS) was used to evaluate the efficacy, and adverse drug reaction scale (TESS) was used to evaluate adverse drug reactions, at the points prior to the treatment, at the end of 4th, 8th, and 12th weeks of treatment, respectively. Fasting blood glucose (FBG), total cholesterol (TC), triglyceride (TG), and low density lipoprotein (LDL‐c) were also measured. RESULTS: There was no significant difference between the two groups in PANSS score at the end of week 4, week 8 and week 12. The curative effect on the two groups was similar. The results of repeated measure ANOVA showed that there were significant differences in FBG (Ftime×group=7.539, p=0.001), TC(Ftime×group=32.194, p<0.001), TG(Ftime×group=488.312, p<0.001), and LDL‐c (Ftime×group=9.380, p<0.001)between the study group and the control group across the different time points.

However, it is frequently associated with excessive body weight (BW) gain, type 2 diabetes mellitus and hyperlipidemia. The antidiabetic metformin (MET) has proved effective to assist in BW control during olanzapine administration. Therefore, we aimed to test whether MET may improve the metabolic profile in patients under prolonged clozapine administration. METHODS: In a double‐blind, parallel group protocol, 61 patients (94.4% with schizophrenia) receiving clozapine (196.8+/‐132 mg daily, range: 25‐500) for more than 3 consecutive months (86.5+/‐40.6 months, range: 4‐168) were randomly allocated to extended release MET (n=31; 500 to 1000 mg daily) or placebo (n=30) group for 14 weeks. The BW, the body mass index, waist circumference, serum glucose, insulin, lipids, glycated hemoglobin (HBA1c), leptin and cortisol, and the HOMA‐IR index were assessed at baseline, and weeks 7 and 14. RESULTS: MET was well tolerated and the mental state was not impaired during the study. The protocol was completed by all the placebo subjects and by 24 MET‐treated patients. In a complete analysis at week 14, without including data of the 7 dropouts, the MET group lost ‐1.87+/‐2.9 kg, whereas the placebo group had a stable BW: 0.16+/‐2.9 kg, p=0.01 for the between group comparisons (effect size: 0.70).

Nizatidine, H2 receptor antagonist, has been proposed to have weight‐reducing effects. This was a 12‐week, randomized, double‐blind, placebo‐controlled trial to evaluate the efficacy of nizatidine in reducing/limiting weight gain in patients with schizophrenia who have been under treatment with olanzapine. METHOD: Patients receiving olanzapine (2 to 6 months) and weight gain >or= 5% of their body weight during olanzapine treatment were randomly assigned to receive nizatidine 600 mg or placebo for up to 12 weeks. Change in psychopathology was assessed using Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale scores from baseline to endpoint. Safety was assessed using the Safety Assessed Software, assessment of glucose and lipid blood levels, and treatment‐emergent adverse events. RESULTS: Out of 54 patients enrolled in this analysis, 45 completed the protocol. The mean weight change prior randomization was 7.6 kg and 7.3 kg for those randomized to placebo and nizatidine, respectively (p = 0.828).

METHODS: This randomized, double‐blind, placebo‐controlled clinical trial included 40 patients with a diagnosis of MDD based on DSM‐IV criteria whose age ranged between 20 and 55 y. Patients were randomly allocated into two groups to receive either probiotic supplements (n = 20) or placebo (n = 20) for 8 wk. Probiotic capsule consisted of three viable and freeze‐dried strains: Lactobacillus acidophilus (2 × 10(9) CFU/g), Lactobacillus casei (2 × 10(9) CFU/g), and Bifidobacterium bifidum (2 × 10(9) CFU/g). Fasting blood samples were taken at the beginning and end of the trial to quantify the relevant variables. All participants provided three dietary records (two weekdays and one weekend) and three physical activity records during the intervention. RESULTS: Dietary intake of study participants was not significantly different between the two groups.

However, these medications due to metabolic disorders can lead to an increased risk of cardiovascular disease and subsequently mortality as well as reduced adherence to treatment. The main objective of current study was to determine the ability of melatonin to reduce the metabolic effects of second‐generation antipsychotics. METHODS: This double blind controlled clinical trial was conducted on 100 patients aged 18‐64 years old were treated with the second‐generation antipsychotics for the first time. The patients were divided randomly into two groups of 50. The case group received slow‐release melatonin at a dose of 3mg and the control group was given oral placebo at 8 p.m. RESULTS: The findings in melatonin group indicated significantly increase of HDL and decreased fasting blood sugar and systolic blood pressure, as well as had statistically significant increase in waist circumference, weight and BMI compared with placebo group. CONCLUSION: According to the findings, it can be claimed that the addition of melatonin to atypical antipsychotics has led to a reduction in some of the metabolic effects of these drugs. In this study, HDL level was increased, and the mean systolic blood pressure and FBS were decreased in the melatonin group. Considering that these factors are contributing to cardiovascular disease as a leading cause of mortality in psychiatric patients, so the use of melatonin can reduce some of the medical effects of long‐term treatment of atypical antipsychotics.","12","1","9‐15","Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL)","PUBMED 28847468",,,,,"Journal article","Adolescent; Adult; Antipsychotic Agents [*adverse effects]; Case‐Control Studies; Central Nervous System Depressants [*therapeutic use]; Double‐Blind Method; Female; Follow‐Up Studies; Humans; Male; Melatonin [*therapeutic use]; Mental Disorders [*drug therapy]; Metabolic Syndrome [chemically induced, *drug therapy]; Middle Aged; Prognosis; Young Adult","10.1016/j.dsx.2017.08.004","https://www.cochranelibrary.com/central/doi/10.1002/central/CN-01415347/full","Schizophrenia"
