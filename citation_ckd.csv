Methods: A total of 104 ESRD patients with peritoneal dialysis who met the inclusion criteria of the protocol were enrolled and randomized to receive nutritional intervention plus individualized nursing (study group, n = 52 analyzed) or self‐diet plus routine nursing (control group, n=50 analyzed) for 6 months. Nutritional risk, anthropometry, and QOL of the two groups were analyzed pre‐ and post‐nutritional intervention. Results: Baseline data were comparable in the two groups. Prevalences of nutritional risk and undernutrition in study group were significant lower than those in control group after the intervention (nutritional risk: 32.6% vs. 56.0%, P = 0.028; undernutrition: 15.4% vs. 34.0% , P = 0.038). The decrease of grip strength in study group between pre‐ and post‐study was significantly less than that in control group [(‐1.6 ± 0.9) kg vs. (‐9.9 ± 1.4) kg, P = 0.001], but there were no significant differences in other parameters related to anthropometry, including triceps skin‐fold thickness, upper arm circumference, and arm muscle circumference (all P > 0.05). The QOL score significantly increased in study group after intervention but decreased in control group. The differences of renal disease and dialysis‐related scores (ΔKDTA: 2.5 ± 4.4 vs. ‐ 7.9 ± 7.4, P = 0.001) and general condition scores (ASF‐36: 3.4 ± 4.1 vs. ‐6.8 ± 6.3, P = 0.001) before and after intervention were significantly different between two groups. Conclusion: Nutrition intervention and individualized nursing may help to improve the nutritional status and QOL in ESRD patients with peritoneal dialysis.","19","4","222‐226","Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL)",,"EMBASE 362677283",,,,"Journal article","*diet therapy; *kidney failure /disease management /therapy; *nursing intervention; *peritoneal dialysis; Anthropometry; Article; Controlled study; Grip strength; Human; Major clinical study; Malnutrition /complication; Nursing care; Nutritional status; Outcome assessment; Personalized medicine; Randomized controlled trial; Risk assessment; Skinfold thickness","10.3760/cma.j.issn.1674-635X.2011.04.002","https://www.cochranelibrary.com/central/doi/10.1002/central/CN-00893800/full",

Twelve consecutive nondiabetic renal transplant recipients were randomly assigned to the isocaloric control or experimental diet group. The six patients ingesting the experimental diet achieved positive nitrogen balance whereas five of the six patients on the control diet had a negative nitrogen balance. The nitrogen balance varied directly and proportionately with the protein intake. Potassium balance mirrored the nitrogen balance data. Cushingoid side effects did not develop in any of the six experimental diet patients whereas four of the six control diet patients had evidence of severe cushingoid appearance and two had moderate cushingoid appearance (P = .01). Based upon the findings of this study, we suggest that the renal transplant recipient's diet could be altered to provide more protein and less carbohydrate to improve nitrogen balance and prevent cushingoid features. It is possible that a high‐protein, low‐carbohydrate diet may be used by additional patients taking steroids for other disease states to prevent cushingoid side effects and improve nitrogen balance.","6","6","405‐411","Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL)","PUBMED 3907334",,,,,"Journal article","Adult; Body Weight; Dietary Carbohydrates [administration & dosage]; Dietary Fats [administration & dosage]; Dietary Proteins [administration & dosage]; Energy Intake; Female; Humans; Kidney Transplantation; Male; Nitrogen [administration & dosage, metabolism]; Nutritional Physiological Phenomena; Postoperative Period; Potassium [metabolism]; Random Allocation; Sodium [metabolism]; Water‐Electrolyte Balance","10.1016/s0272-6386(85)80103-7","https://www.cochranelibrary.com/central/doi/10.1002/central/CN-00040702/full","Complementary Medicine; Kidney and Transplant"

MATERIALS AND METHODS: We conducted an internal review board‐approved randomized prospective study involving a 12‐month supervised multidisciplinary rehabilitation program (GH method) initiated after kidney transplantation in obese recipients (body mass index >30). The new method incorporates 3 major components: physical exercise, behavioral interventions, and nutritional guidance. We compared 9 patients who underwent supervised rehabilitation with 8 patients who underwent standard care. Patients were followed up after the start of the intervention, and multiple assessments were performed. RESULTS: The adherence to training and follow‐up was 100% in the intervention group, compared with 25% at 12 months in the control group. There was a trend for a higher glomerular filtration rate in the intervention group compared with the control group (55.5 ± 18.6 mL/min/1.73 m(2) vs 38.8 ± 18.9 mL/min/1.73 m(2), P = .06). The quality of life (SF‐36) mean score improved more in the intervention group compared with the control group (583 ± 13 vs 436 ± 22, P = .008). There was a significantly higher employment rate in the intervention group, 77.7% at 12 months compared with 12.5% in the control group (P = .02). CONCLUSIONS: Our preliminary results suggest that this comprehensive approach to physical rehabilitation can improve adherence, kidney function, quality of life, and employment rate for obese patients after kidney transplantation.","46","10","3431‐3437","Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL)","PUBMED 25498067","EMBASE 603563859",,,,"Journal article","*chronic kidney failure/rh [Rehabilitation]; *chronic kidney failure/su [Surgery]; *graft recipient; *kidney transplantation; *obesity/th [Therapy]; *personalized medicine; *rehabilitation care; Adult; Anthropometry; Article; Behavior change; Blood group ABO incompatibility; Body Mass Index; Body composition; Body mass; Bone mineral; Clinical article; Controlled study; Creatinine blood level; Dual energy X ray absorptiometry; Emotional stability; Exercise; Exercise Therapy [*methods]; Exercise [*physiology]; Female; Follow up; Glomerular Filtration Rate; Glomerulus filtration rate; Glucose blood level; Glucose/ec [Endogenous Compound]; Health care quality; Hemoglobin A1c/ec [Endogenous Compound]; High density lipoprotein/ec [Endogenous Compound]; Human; Humans; Kidney Failure, Chronic [complications, physiopathology, *surgery]; Kidney Transplantation; Kidney function; Low density lipoprotein/ec [Endogenous Compound]; Male; Middle Aged; Middle aged; Nutritional support; Obesity [complications, *rehabilitation]; Patient compliance; Pilot study; Priority journal; Prospective Studies; Prospective study; Psychologic assessment; Quality of Life; Quality of life; Short Form 36; Transplant Recipients; Triacylglycerol/ec [Endogenous Compound]; Weight lifting","10.1016/j.transproceed.2014.05.085","https://www.cochranelibrary.com/central/doi/10.1002/central/CN-01079861/full",

DESIGN: We performed a prospective, randomized, controlled trial of dietary intervention involving 59 patients on continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis over a 4‐month follow‐up period. SETTING: The study involved outpatients on home‐based renal replacement therapy. PARTICIPANTS: All participants were adult patients on continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis. All eligible patients were invited to take part. Subjects were randomized into two groups: control and intervention. Those with diabetes mellitus, malabsorption, malignancy, or eating disorders were excluded. INTERVENTION: Baseline measurements to assess current dietary intake and nutritional status were performed in all subjects. Measurements included a 5‐day food diary, subjective global assessment (SGA), anthropometry, and serum biochemistry. After analysis of the food diaries, the participants in the control group were given follow‐up dietary advice that would enable them to match intake with current dietary recommendations for this group of 1.2 g of protein per kilogram of ideal body weight, 25 cal/kg ideal body weight. Participants in the intervention group were given follow‐up dietary advice that would encourage them to match energy intake with an estimate of total energy expenditure based on their calculated basal metabolic rate and physical activity level as designated using information from SGA, with a significantly lower protein intake of 0.8 to 1.0 g/kg ideal body weight and an emphasis on calories from carbohydrate and fat. Both groups completed further 5‐day food diaries at 2 and 4 months to assess their ability to make the recommended changes. SGA, anthropometry, and biochemistry were all remeasured at the end of the study period. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Differences in energy and protein intakes between and within the two groups from baseline to 4 months were assessed. RESULTS: Protein and energy intakes did not change during 4 months in either group, and there was no significant difference in intake between the two groups. In the control group (n = 27), 18 subjects (69%) matched their reported dietary energy intake to the recommended intake. In the intervention group (n = 28), 17 subjects (63%) matched their reported dietary intake to their estimated total energy expenditure. In the control group (n = 27), 8 subjects (28%) achieved the protein intake recommended to them of 1.2 g/kg. In the intervention group (n = 28), 23 subjects (85%) achieved the protein intake recommended to them of greater than 0.8 g/kg. CONCLUSION: Patients not meeting their dietary prescription did not adjust their intake to match the recommended advice they had been given from a dietitian. Food diary analysis showed that subjects ate less than the recommended intakes for energy and protein. This inability to change suggests that subjects may be eating to the limit of their appetite. SGA sections concerning appetite, body weight, body mass index, and estimates of energy expenditure support the view that energy intake matches requirements.","17","5","329‐335","Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL)","PUBMED 17720102",,,,,"Journal article","Appetite [physiology]; Diet, Protein‐Restricted; Dietary Proteins [*administration & dosage]; Eating [physiology]; Energy Intake [*physiology]; Energy Metabolism [physiology]; Female; Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice; Humans; Kidney Failure, Chronic [diet therapy, therapy]; Male; Middle Aged; Nutrition Assessment; Nutrition Policy; Nutritional Requirements; Nutritional Status; Patient Education as Topic [*methods]; Peritoneal Dialysis, Continuous Ambulatory [psychology]; Prospective Studies","10.1053/j.jrn.2007.02.003","https://www.cochranelibrary.com/central/doi/10.1002/central/CN-00611634/full","Kidney and Transplant"

The study protocol was approved by the Committee on Human Research at the Pomeranian Medical University, Szczecin, Poland. An intensification of free‐radical reactions may contribute to accelerated atherosclerosis in kidney graft recipients. We examined the effect of a Mediterranean‐type diet (MD) on the oxidative status of the plasma and erythrocytes of kidney graft recipients. Two patient groups were formed: a study group consuming the MD diet and a control group with a low‐fat diet. C‐reactive protein levels in plasma, oleic acid C18 : 1n‐9 and linoleic acid C18 : 2n‐6 concentrations in triacylglycerols were determined. To determine the oxidative status, we measured the concentrations of alpha‐tocopherol in plasma, the content of thiobarbituric acid‐reactive species (TBARS) in plasma and erythrocytes, and the activities of superoxide dismutase, catalase and glutathione peroxidase in erythrocytes. In the MD group, the activities of erythrocyte enzymes changed significantly: those of superoxide dismutase increased (P<0.001 after 6 months), catalase decreased (P<0.001 after 6 months) and glutathione peroxidase decreased (P<0.05 after 2 months). The oleic acid content of triacylglycerols was increased (P<0.006) whereas that of linoleic acid was decreased (P<0.00005), alpha‐tocopherol levels remaining unchanged. TBARS in plasma were decreased after 6 months of MD (P<0.05). No significant correlations were observed between TBARS, oleic acid, linoleic acid and alpha‐tocopherol levels in plasma. MD appears to protect the erythrocytes against the action of free radicals, as reflected in the modified activities of some enzymes regulating the oxidative status of these blood cells.","93","3","345‐352","Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL)","PUBMED 15877874",,,,,"Journal article","Adult; C‐Reactive Protein [analysis]; Diet, Mediterranean; Erythrocytes [enzymology]; Glutathione Peroxidase [blood]; Humans; Kidney Transplantation [*physiology]; Middle Aged; Oxidation‐Reduction; Oxidative Stress; Superoxide Dismutase [blood]; Thiobarbituric Acid Reactive Substances [analysis]; Triglycerides [blood]; alpha‐Tocopherol [blood]","10.1079/bjn20051374","https://www.cochranelibrary.com/central/doi/10.1002/central/CN-00511971/full","Complementary Medicine; Kidney and Transplant"

DESIGN: Randomized, prospective study. SETTING: Outpatient Clinic of the Department of Nephrology, Transplantology, and Internal Medicine. PATIENTS AND INTERVENTION: The study group consisted of 21 patients after kidney transplantation whose diet complied with the MD; the control group included 16 patients (also after transplantation) on a low‐fat diet, isocaloric with the study diet. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Anthropometry, plasma lipids, chromatography of triacylglycerols and fatty acids, and activity of superoxide dismutase and catalase were measured in both groups. Statistical analysis was done with the SNN (Statistica Neural Networks) StatSoft software package. RESULTS: The advantage of neural networks is the possibility of the dynamic presentation of a process taking place in a biological system. In the MD group in the first months of use of the diet, the cholesterol level was reduced only in the group of young and middle‐aged patients. This tendency was not observed among elderly patients, among whom a small reduction of the total cholesterol level was noted only at the end of the observation period. In control group at the beginning of the observation, the plasma total cholesterol level was proportional to the patient's age. After 6 months, the total cholesterol increased in young patients and redacted in the group of elderly patients. CONCLUSIONS: We concluded that the MD diet would be ideal for posttransplantation patients without serious pathologic dyslipidemia. In the case of patients with substantial dyslipidemia, appropriate pharmacologic treatment lowering proatherosclerotic lipid levels should be used in combination with the MD. Artificial neural networks (ANNs) were a useful tool in modeling biological parameters, showing dynamics of the studied interactions in a very detailed way. ANN is the most suitable method for investigations with many variables, interconnected nonlinearly; therefore, this method allows for a more general approach to biological problems. However, it should be noted that considerable data sets are required to obtain a satisfactory fit to the data. Moreover, to ensure the predictive power of this method for new cases, the representative database is indispensable. In spite of these demands, ANN is a prospective tool for reliable, quick assessments and predictions.","16","2","150‐159","Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL)","PUBMED 16567272",,,,,"Journal article","Adult; Body Mass Index; Catalase [blood]; Cholesterol, LDL [blood]; Diet, Fat‐Restricted; Diet, Mediterranean; Energy Intake; Fatty Acids [blood]; Female; Humans; Kidney Transplantation; Lipids [*blood]; Male; Middle Aged; Neural Networks, Computer; Triglycerides [blood]; Waist‐Hip Ratio","10.1053/j.jrn.2006.01.003","https://www.cochranelibrary.com/central/doi/10.1002/central/CN-00563684/full","Metabolic and Endocrine Disorders; Kidney and Transplant"

Dietary adjustments in CKD are complex and the patients' compliance is very low. A key process to obtain adequate adherence to low‐protein diets in CKD is to provide individualized dietary programs joined with specific continuous counselling by skilled renal dietitians; even better results can be obtained with intensive counselling/education programs These golden strategies, however, need dedicated renal dietitians and are time consuming . Unfortunately, most nephrology centers do not have either dedicated dietitians or even renal nutritional programs; as a result, it is usual practice to give either standard, non‐individualized low protein diets without any counselling or no LPDs at all to CKD patients not on dialysis, thus reducing the hypothetical clinical impact of LPD. Aim of this study was to verify if a simplified dietary approach self‐managed by the patient may accomplish our goals to have a beneficial impact on the metabolic and nutritional control of renal failure, to be well accepted by the patients and to be safe. Methods: 54 patients were randomly assigned to the two test diets: 27 patients were assigned to receive the 6‐points‐diet (Group 6‐PD), and 27 were randomized to receive a basic LPD (Group LPD). The patients of the Group 6‐PD received by the Nephrologist a list of six items indicating how to modify their dietary habits; all the items were thoroughly explained and discussed with the patients (Table 1). The other 27 patients received a standard LPD containing 0.7‐0.8 grams of proteins per kilo of desirable body weight per day.We evaluated after 1 (T1), 3 (T3) and 6 (T6) months of follow‐up the effects on renal disease progression, metabolic control, nutritional status and compliance to the dietetic prescription in the two diet groups. Results: 12 patients of LPD group resulted compliant to protein prescription against 19 of the 6PD group (70%) (p=0.05 between the groups).The protein intake progressively and significantly decreased in both groups, with a similar pattern during the study period. The phosphate intake of the two diet groups, similar at the time of randomization, diverged significantly during the 6 months follow‐up, being lower in 6PD group ( p=0.046). The other 'metabolic' blood parameters were substantially similar in the two groups, and were all maintained in a satisfactory range for given target. None of the patients from both groups registered a weight loss according to the given malnutrition criterion; however, during the follow‐up, patients from the LPD group had a weight loss more evident compared to the 6PD group (p=0.047); as well, the other nutritional parameters did not change during the follow‐up in both groups. Also, the monthly loss of eGFR was more evident in the LPD group compared to 6PD group (P = 0.01). Conclusions: In CKD stage 3b‐5, in clinical settings were close nutritional monitoring is not available, a simplified low protein diet obtained by giving to patients few, simple tips to modify some major nutritional behaviour while maintaining their usual habits, allows to obtain a good adherence to protein restriction, improving the metabolic abnormalities of CKD, and it is safe.

DESIGN: Randomized controlled trial. SETTING: Hospital outpatient department. PATIENTS: Adult RTR with AGT. INTERVENTION: RTR with AGT were randomized to a lifestyle intervention that consisted of either regular consultations with the dietitian and multidisciplinary team or standard care. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Dietary intake, physical activity (PA) levels, cardiorespiratory fitness (CF), and anthropometry. RESULTS: Total fat and percent saturated fat intake rates were significantly lower in the intervention group as compared with the control group at 2‐year follow‐up, 54 g (16 to 105 g) versus 65 g (34 to 118 g), P = .01 and 10% (5% to 17%) versus 13% (4% to 20%), P = .05., respectively. There was a trend for an overweight (but not obese) individual to lose more weight in the intervention group (4% loss vs. a gain of 0.25% at the 2‐year follow‐up). Overall, RTR were significantly less fit than age‐ and gender‐matched controls, mean peak oxygen uptake was 19.42 ± 7.09 mL/kg per minute versus 28.35 ± 8.80 mL/kg per minute, P = .000. Simple exercise advice was not associated with any improvement in total PA or CF in either group at the 2‐year follow‐up. CONCLUSION: Dietary advice can contribute to healthier eating habits and a trend for weight loss in RTR with AGT. These improvements in conjunction with multidisciplinary care and pharmacological treatment can lead to improvements in cardiovascular risk factors such as lipid profile. Simple advice to increase PA was not effective in improving CF and other measures are needed.","21","6","462‐471","Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL)","PUBMED 21454091",,,,,"Journal article","Adult; Aged; Anthropometry; Australia; Blood Pressure; Cardiovascular Diseases [etiology, *prevention & control]; Diet, Mediterranean; Dietary Fats [administration & dosage]; Dietetics; Energy Intake; Feeding Behavior; Female; Follow‐Up Studies; Food, Organic; Glucose Intolerance [complications, prevention & control]; Humans; Kidney Transplantation [*adverse effects]; Life Style; Male; Middle Aged; Motor Activity; Obesity [complications, prevention & control]; Patient Compliance; Risk Factors","10.1053/j.jrn.2010.12.002","https://www.cochranelibrary.com/central/doi/10.1002/central/CN-00897637/full",

The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of nutritional advice on dyslipidemia and biomarkers in CRF patients. 40 CRF patients with dyslipidemia, hypertriglyceridemia and/or hypercholesterolemia were randomly assigned to either the control or the intervention group. The intervention group received nutritional advice adapted to a Mediterranean diet (MD). Patients were assessed at baseline (T0) and after 30 (T1), 60 (T2) and 90 (T3) days for dietary intake and biomarkers. In the intervention group compared to the control group, TG concentrations were decreased by 26% at T3 (p < 0.05), TC concentrations were diminished by 14% at T2 and by 35% at T3 (p < 0.05). A decrease in LDL‐C was noted at T2 and T3 (p < 0.05). The TC/HDL‐C ratio was diminished at T1, T2 and T3 (p < 0.05). The apo A‐I/apo B ratio was elevated at T3 (p < 0.05). HDL‐C, apo A‐I, apo B concentrations and the TC/LDL‐C ratio were similar in the both groups at T1, T2 and T3. Creatinine, urea, glomerular filtration rate (GFR), urate, iron and bilirubin values remained unchanged in both groups. Haemoglobin concentrations were elevated at T1 (p < 0.05). Increased albumin values were observed at T2 (p < 0.05). CRP concentrations were decreased by 29% at T1 (p < 0.05) and 40% (p < 0.01) at T3. Fibrinogen (p < 0.01) concentrations were decreased at T3.

Moreover, the relative importance of nutritional barriers versus inflammation in contributing to hypoalbuminemia is unclear. We sought to determine whether targeting specific nutritional barriers will improve albumin levels. METHODS: We conducted a randomized controlled trial involving 180 patients with baseline albumin levels less than 3.7 g/dL (<37 g/L) at 44 long‐term hemodialysis facilities. Study coordinators identified and intervened on specific barriers present among intervention patients, whereas control patients continued to receive the usual care. Barriers targeted included poor nutritional knowledge, poor appetite, help needed with shopping or cooking, low fluid intake, inadequate dialysis dose, depression, difficulty chewing, difficulty swallowing, gastrointestinal symptoms, and acidosis. RESULTS: At baseline, intervention and control patients had similar albumin levels, dietary intakes, levels of inflammatory markers, and numbers of nutritional barriers. After 12 months, intervention patients had greater increases in albumin levels compared with control patients (+0.21 versus +0.06 g/dL [+2.1 versus +0.6 g/L]; P < 0.01), as well as greater increases in energy intake (+4.1 versus ‐0.6 Kcal/d/kg; P < 0.001) and protein intake (+0.13 versus ‐0.06 g/d/kg; P < 0.001). The intervention appeared most effective for barriers related to poor nutritional knowledge, help needed with shopping or cooking, and difficulty swallowing. About half the subjects had elevated levels of inflammatory markers, but there was no relationship between change in levels of albumin and inflammatory markers. CONCLUSION: A nutrition intervention tailored to patient‐specific barriers resulted in modest improvements in albumin levels regardless of levels of inflammatory markers.","48","1","28‐36","Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL)","PUBMED 16797384","EMBASE 43912942",,,,"Journal article","*albumin/ec [Endogenous Compound]; *hemodialysis; Acidosis; Adult; Anorexia; Appetite; Article; Biomarkers [blood]; Caloric intake; Clinical trial; Controlled clinical trial; Controlled study; Cooking; Deglutition Disorders; Depression; Diet; Dietary intake; Female; Fluid intake; Gastrointestinal symptom; Human; Humans; Hypoalbuminemia [*etiology, *prevention & control]; Inflammation; Major clinical study; Male; Mastication; Middle Aged; Nutrition; Nutritional Status; Patient Education as Topic; Protein intake; Randomization; Randomized controlled trial; Renal Dialysis [*adverse effects]; Swallowing; Water‐Electrolyte Balance","10.1053/j.ajkd.2006.03.046","https://www.cochranelibrary.com/central/doi/10.1002/central/CN-00557106/full","Kidney and Transplant"

Since angiotensin II mediates GFR decline in partial nephrectomy models of CKD and even mild metabolic acidosis increases kidney angiotensin II in animals, alkali treatment of CKD‐related metabolic acidosis in patients with plasma TCO2 over 22 mmol/l might preserve GFR through reduced kidney angiotensin II. To test this, we randomized 108 patients with stage 3 CKD and plasma TCO2 22‐24 mmol/l to Usual Care or interventions designed to reduce dietary acid by 50% using sodium bicarbonate or base‐producing fruits and vegetables. All were treated to achieve a systolic blood pressure below 130 mm Hg with regimens including angiotensin converting enzyme inhibition and followed for 3 years. Plasma TCO2 decreased in Usual Care but increased with bicarbonate or fruits and vegetables. By contrast, urine excretion of angiotensinogen, an index of kidney angiotensin II, increased in Usual Care but decreased with bicarbonate or fruits and vegetables. Creatinine‐calculated and cystatin C‐calculated eGFR decreased in all groups, but loss was less at 3 years with bicarbonate or fruits and vegetables than Usual Care. Thus, dietary alkali treatment of metabolic acidosis in CKD that is less severe than that for which KDOQI recommends therapy reduces kidney angiotensin II activity and preserves eGFR.","86","5","1031‐1038","Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL)","PUBMED 24694986","EMBASE 53083730",,,,"Journal article","*angiotensinogen/ec [Endogenous Compound]; *bicarbonate/ct [Clinical Trial]; *bicarbonate/dt [Drug Therapy]; *bicarbonate/po [Oral Drug Administration]; *chronic kidney disease; *fruit; *glomerulus filtration rate; *metabolic acidosis/dt [Drug Therapy]; *metabolic acidosis/th [Therapy]; *vegetable; Acidosis [diagnosis, etiology, physiopathology, *therapy, urine]; Acid‐Base Equilibrium [drug effects]; Administration, Oral; Adult; Albuminuria; Angiotensin II/ec [Endogenous Compound]; Angiotensinogen [*urine]; Article; Bicarbonates [*administration & dosage]; Biomarkers [urine]; Carbon dioxide blood level; Carbon dioxide/ec [Endogenous Compound]; Controlled study; Creatinine/ec [Endogenous Compound]; Diet; Diet restriction; Dipeptidyl carboxypeptidase inhibitor; Enalapril; Female; Fruit; Glomerular Filtration Rate [*drug effects]; Human; Humans; Kidney [*drug effects, metabolism, physiopathology]; Major clinical study; Male; Middle Aged; Randomized controlled trial; Renal Insufficiency, Chronic [complications, diagnosis, physiopathology, *therapy, urine]; Systolic blood pressure; Time Factors; Treatment Outcome; Urinary excretion; Vegetables","10.1038/ki.2014.83","https://www.cochranelibrary.com/central/doi/10.1002/central/CN-01022089/full",

Because diets in industrialized societies are typically acid‐producing, we compared base‐producing fruits and vegetables with oral NaHCO3 (HCO3) regarding the primary outcome of follow‐up estimated GFR (eGFR) and secondary outcomes of improved metabolic acidosis and reduced urine indices of kidney injury. DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS, & MEASUREMENTS: Individuals with stage 4 (eGFR, 15‐29 ml/min per 1.73 m(2)) CKD due to hypertensive nephropathy, had a PTCO2 level < 22 mM, and were receiving angiotensin‐converting enzyme inhibition were randomly assigned to 1 year of daily oral NaHCO3 at 1.0 mEq/kg per day (n=35) or fruits and vegetables dosed to reduce dietary acid by half (n=36). RESULTS: Plasma cystatin C‐calculated eGFR did not differ at baseline and 1 year between groups. One‐year PTCO2 was higher than baseline in the HCO3 group (21.2±1.3 versus 19.5±1.5 mM; P<0.01) and the fruits and vegetables group (19.9±1.7 versus 19.3±1.9 mM; P<0.01), consistent with improved metabolic acidosis, and was higher in the HCO3 than the fruits and vegetable group (P<0.001). One‐year urine indices of kidney injury were lower than baseline in both groups. Plasma [K(+)] did not increase in either group. CONCLUSIONS: One year of fruits and vegetables or NaHCO3 in individuals with stage 4 CKD yielded eGFR that was not different, was associated with higher‐than‐baseline PTCO2, and was associated with lower‐than‐baseline urine indices of kidney injury. The data indicate that fruits and vegetables improve metabolic acidosis and reduce kidney injury in stage 4 CKD without producing hyperkalemia.","8","3","371‐381","Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL)","PUBMED 23393104",,,,,"Journal article","Acidosis [diagnosis, *diet therapy, *drug therapy, etiology]; Acid‐Base Equilibrium [drug effects]; Administration, Oral; Angiotensin‐Converting Enzyme Inhibitors [therapeutic use]; Antihypertensive Agents [therapeutic use]; Biomarkers [blood, urine]; Diet [adverse effects]; Female; Fruit; Glomerular Filtration Rate [drug effects]; Humans; Hypertension [*complications, drug therapy]; Kidney [drug effects, physiopathology]; Male; Middle Aged; Potassium [blood]; Renal Insufficiency, Chronic [diagnosis, *diet therapy, *drug therapy, etiology]; Sodium Bicarbonate [administration & dosage, adverse effects, *therapeutic use]; Texas; Time Factors; Treatment Outcome; Vegetables","10.2215/CJN.02430312","https://www.cochranelibrary.com/central/doi/10.1002/central/CN-00871173/full","Hypertension"

The main purpose of the research was to determine whether the addition of these services would slow the progression of certain CKD parameters. METHODS: The study evaluated 5 endpoints, at baseline, 6 months, and 12 months: urinary protein, blood pressure, urinary sodium, glomerular filtration rate, and total cholesterol between 2 groups (control group receiving CKD standard care and experimental group receiving standard care plus cooking and exercise classes). Eighty percent of the experimental group was hypothesized to improve in 4 out of the 5 endpoints versus ≤50% in the control group with a P‐value of 0.05. An overall difference of 30% was anticipated between the 2 groups. The research also compared self‐efficacy and health status outcomes using a self‐management questionnaire. RESULTS: Forty randomly assigned patients participated in the study (17 controls and 23 experimental). In the control group, 2 of 17 people improved in at least 4 of the 5 endpoints. In the experimental group, 14 of 23 people improved in at least 4 of the 5 endpoints. CONCLUSIONS: Sixty‐one percent of experimental subjects showed improvements in 4 of 5 endpoints, showing a significant difference overall when compared with the control group (12% improved in 4 out of 5 endpoints).

Several lines of evidence suggest dietary factors other than protein intake have a substantial role in the progression of diabetic nephropathy to end‐stage renal disease. The present investigation was initiated to evaluate whether a carbohydrate‐restricted, low‐iron‐available, polyphenol‐enriched (CR‐LIPE) diet may delay and improve the outcome of diabetic nephropathy to a greater extent than standard protein restriction. To this aim, 191 diabetic patients, all with type 2 diabetes, were randomized to either CR‐LIPE or standard protein restriction and the following outcomes monitored: doubling of serum creatinine, cumulative incidence of end‐stage renal disease, and all cause mortality. Over a mean follow‐up interval of 3.9 +/‐ 1.8 years, serum creatinine concentration doubled in 19 patients on CR‐LIPE (21%) and in 31 control subjects (39%) (P < 0.01). Renal replacement therapy or death occurred in 18 patients on CR‐LIPE (20%) and in 31 control subjects (39%) (P < 0.01). These differences were independent from follow‐up interval, sex, mean arterial blood pressure, HbA(1c), initial renal dysfunction, and angiotensin system inhibitor use. In conclusion, CR‐LIPE was 40‐50% more effective than standard protein restriction in improving renal and overall survival rates.","52","5","1204‐1209","Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL)","PUBMED 12716753","EMBASE 36523357",,,,"Journal article","*carbohydrate; *diabetic nephropathy; *diet restriction; *iron; *polyphenol; Adult; Article; Body Mass Index; Clinical trial; Controlled clinical trial; Controlled study; Creatinine blood level; Creatinine/ec [Endogenous Compound]; Diabetic Nephropathies [diet therapy, *prevention & control]; Diet, Diabetic; Dietary Carbohydrates; Disease Progression; Female; Flavonoids; Follow up; Follow‐Up Studies; Hemoglobin A1c/ec [Endogenous Compound]; Hemoglobins [metabolism]; Human; Humans; Iron; Kidney Failure, Chronic [*prevention & control]; Kidney failure; Kidney transplantation; Major clinical study; Male; Mean arterial pressure; Middle Aged; Mortality; Non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; Phenols; Polymers; Polyphenols; Priority journal; Protein restriction; Randomized controlled trial; Reference Values; Survival rate; Time Factors","10.2337/diabetes.52.5.1204","https://www.cochranelibrary.com/central/doi/10.1002/central/CN-00558670/full","Complementary Medicine; Metabolic and Endocrine Disorders; Kidney and Transplant"

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: In the 2‐year Dietary Intervention Randomized Controlled Trial (DIRECT), 318 participants (age, 51 years; 86% men; BMI, 31 kg/m(2); mean estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR], 70.5 mL/min/1.73 m(2); mean urine microalbumin‐to‐creatinine ratio, 12:12) with serum creatinine <176 μmol/L (eGFR ≥ 30 mL/min/1.73 m(2)) were randomized to low‐fat, Mediterranean, or low‐carbohydrate diets. The 2‐year compliance was 85%, and the proportion of protein intake significantly increased to 22% of energy only in the low‐carbohydrate diet (P < 0.05 vs. low‐fat and Mediterranean). We examined changes in urinary microalbumin and eGFR, estimated by Modification of Diet in Renal Disease and Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration formulas. RESULTS: Significant (P < 0.05 within groups) improvements in eGFR were achieved in low‐carbohydrate (+5.3% [95% CI 2.1‐8.5]), Mediterranean (+5.2% [3.0‐7.4]), and low‐fat diets (+4.0% [0.9‐7.1]) with similar magnitude (P > 0.05) across diet groups. The increased eGFR was at least as prominent in participants with (+6.7%) or without (+4.5%) type 2 diabetes or those with lower baseline renal function of eGFR <60 mL/min/1.73 m(2) (+7.1%) versus eGFR ≥ 60 mL/min/1.73 m(2) (+3.7%). In a multivariable model adjusted for age, sex, diet group, type 2 diabetes, use of ACE inhibitors, 2‐year weight loss, and change in protein intake (confounders and univariate predictors), only a decrease in fasting insulin (β = ‐0.211; P = 0.004) and systolic blood pressure (β = ‐0.25; P < 0.001) were independently associated with increased eGFR. The urine microalbumin‐to‐creatinine ratio improved similarly across the diets, particularly among participants with baseline sex‐adjusted microalbuminuria, with a mean change of ‐24.8 (P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: A low‐carbohydrate diet is as safe as Mediterranean or low‐fat diets in preserving/improving renal function among moderately obese participants with or without type 2 diabetes, with baseline serum creatinine <176 μmol/L. Potential improvement is likely to be mediated by weight loss‐induced improvements in insulin sensitivity and blood pressure.","36","8","2225‐2232","Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL)","PUBMED 23690533","EMBASE 370081031","","","","Journal article","*kidney function; *low carbohydrate diet; *non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus/th [Therapy]; *protein diet; Adult; Age; Albumin blood level; Albumin/ec [Endogenous Compound]; Albuminuria [urine]; Article; Blood pressure regulation; Body mass; Controlled study; Creatinine [urine]; Creatinine blood level; Creatinine/ec [Endogenous Compound]; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2 [*physiopathology]; Diet, Carbohydrate‐Restricted; Diet, Fat‐Restricted; Diet, Mediterranean; Dipeptidyl carboxypeptidase inhibitor; Female; Gender; Glomerular Filtration Rate; Glomerulus filtration rate; Human; Humans; Insulin sensitivity; Ischemic heart disease; Kidney Function Tests; Kidney [*physiology]; Major clinical study; Male; Mediterranean diet; Middle Aged; Obesity; Obesity [*diet therapy]; Patient Compliance; Protein urine level; Randomized controlled trial; Renal Insufficiency, Chronic [diet therapy, physiopathology]; Systolic blood pressure; Treatment response; Weight Loss; Weight reduction","10.2337/dc12-1846","https://www.cochranelibrary.com/central/doi/10.1002/central/CN-00978577/full",

This study aims to investigate whether providing individualised nutritional counselling can improve nutritional status and influence quality of life in pre‐dialysis chronic kidney disease patients. METHODS: Fifty‐three stage IV and V pre‐dialysis chronic kidney disease patients underwent assessment of nutritional status (by Patient Generated Subjective Global Assessment) and quality of life (by Kidney Disease Quality of Life). Participants were assessed at baseline and following a 12‐week randomised‐controlled treatment, allocated to either individualised counselling with regular follow‐up (n=24) or standard care treatment (generic education only (n=23)). RESULTS: At baseline, nutritional status was significantly correlated with all general quality of life sub‐scales. There was a statistically significant mean difference in change between groups for: symptoms of kidney disease (7.1 (0.1‐14.1) p=0.047); cognitive functioning (14.6 (5.4‐23.7) p=0.003); and vitality (12.0 (4.6‐19.5) p=0.002) favouring intervention treatment.

INTERVENTION: The intervention group, provided with individualized dietary counseling with regular follow‐up aimed at achieving an intake of 0.8 to 1.0 g/kg of protein and greater than 125 kJ/kg of energy, or control, receiving written material only. OUTCOMES & MEASURES: Change in body composition (body cell mass, measured by means of total‐body potassium, in 40 of 56 participants), nutritional status (Subjective Global Assessment), and energy and protein intake (3‐day food record). RESULTS: During the 12 weeks, the intervention group had 3.5% (95% confidence interval, ‐2.1 to 9.1) less decrease in body cell mass, 17.7‐kJ/kg/d (95% confidence interval, 8.2 to 27.2) greater increase in energy intake, greater improvement in Subjective Global Assessment (P < 0.01), and no significant difference in protein intake compared with the control group (‐0.04 g/kg/d; 95% confidence interval, ‐0.73 to 0.16). The intervention was associated with greater increases in energy and protein intake in women than men (interaction P < 0.001 for both). LIMITATIONS: Power to detect change in body cell mass, potential bias in ascertainment of Subjective Global Assessment.
