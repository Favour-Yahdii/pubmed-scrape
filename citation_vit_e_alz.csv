The Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study","New England journal of medicine","1997","BACKGROUND: There is evidence that medications or vitamins that increase the levels of brain catecholamines and protect against oxidative damage may reduce the neuronal damage and slow the progression of Alzheimer's disease. METHODS: We conducted a double‐blind, placebo‐controlled, randomized, multicenter trial in patients with Alzheimer's disease of moderate severity. A total of 341 patients received the selective monoamine oxidase inhibitor selegiline (10 mg a day), alpha‐tocopherol (vitamin E, 2000 IU a day), both selegiline and alpha‐tocopherol, or placebo for two years. The primary outcome was the time to the occurrence of any of the following: death, institutionalization, loss of the ability to perform basic activities of daily living, or severe dementia (defined as a Clinical Dementia Rating of 3). RESULTS: Despite random assignment, the baseline score on the Mini‐Mental State Examination was higher in the placebo group than in the other three groups, and this variable was highly predictive of the primary outcome (P<0.001). In the unadjusted analyses, there was no statistically significant difference in the outcomes among the four groups. In analyses that included the base‐line score on the Mini‐Mental State Examination as a covariate, there were significant delays in the time to the primary outcome for the patients treated with selegiline (median time, 655 days; P=0.012), alpha‐tocopherol (670 days, P=0.001) or combination therapy (585 days, P=0.049), as compared with the placebo group (440 days). CONCLUSIONS: In patients with moderately severe impairment from Alzheimer's disease, treatment with selegiline or alpha‐tocopherol slows the progression of disease.","336","17","1216‐1222","Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL)","PUBMED 9110909",,,,,"Journal article","Activities of Daily Living; Aged; Alzheimer Disease [*drug therapy, mortality]; Cognition [drug effects]; Disease Progression; Double‐Blind Method; Drug Combinations; Female; Humans; Institutionalization; Male; Mental Status Schedule; Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors [*therapeutic use]; Proportional Hazards Models; Selegiline [*therapeutic use]; Treatment Outcome; Vitamin E [*therapeutic use]","10.1056/NEJM199704243361704","https://www.cochranelibrary.com/central/doi/10.1002/central/CN-00138257/full","Complementary Medicine; Dementia and Cognitive Improvement"

Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study","Alzheimer disease and associated disorders","1996","This report describes the rationale and design of a clinical trial using selegiline (10 mg/day) and alpha‐tocopherol (2,000 IU/day) to slow the progression of dementia in Alzheimer disease (AD). This study was developed by the Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study (ADCS), a consortium of clinical research centers actively involved in AD research. The major goal of the consortium is to design and conduct clinical investigations leading to the development of treatments for AD. This study uses a randomized double‐blind, placebo‐controlled, 2 x 2 factorial, parallel group design to test two drugs for the treatment of AD. The primary outcome of the study is the time to reach any one of the following four endpoints: death, institutionalization, loss of two of three basic activities of daily living, and progression of Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) stage from 2 to 3. Patients with moderately severe disease (CDR = 2) were enrolled and evaluated 10 times over a period of 2 years to determine if these agents reduce the time to reach any endpoint. A database from the Consortium to Establish a Registry for Alzheimer's Disease indicated adequate power analyses to observe a treatment effect on this clinically meaningful outcome measure. Recruitment and baseline characteristics of the population are provided. The rationale for the choice of a factorial design, the use of a novel, clinically meaningful endpoint, and the selection of a cohort of patients with AD of moderate severity are discussed.","10","3","132‐140","Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL)","PUBMED 8876776","EMBASE 26306099",,,,"Journal article","Aged; Alzheimer Disease [*drug therapy]; Female; Humans; Male; Multicenter Studies as Topic; Neuropsychological Tests; Research Design; Selegiline [*therapeutic use]; Vitamin E [*therapeutic use]","10.1097/00002093-199601030-00004","https://www.cochranelibrary.com/central/doi/10.1002/central/CN-00132141/full","Hepato-Biliary"

METHODS: In a double‐blind study, we evaluated subjects with the amnestic subtype of mild cognitive impairment. Subjects were randomly assigned to receive 2000 IU of vitamin E daily, 10 mg of donepezil daily, or placebo for three years. The primary outcome was clinically possible or probable Alzheimer's disease; secondary outcomes were cognition and function. RESULTS: A total of 769 subjects were enrolled, and possible or probable Alzheimer's disease developed in 212. The overall rate of progression from mild cognitive impairment to Alzheimer's disease was 16 percent per year. As compared with the placebo group, there were no significant differences in the probability of progression to Alzheimer's disease in the vitamin E group (hazard ratio, 1.02; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.74 to 1.41; P=0.91) or the donepezil group (hazard ratio, 0.80; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.57 to 1.13; P=0.42) during the three years of treatment. Prespecified analyses of the treatment effects at 6‐month intervals showed that as compared with the placebo group, the donepezil group had a reduced likelihood of progression to Alzheimer's disease during the first 12 months of the study (P=0.04), a finding supported by the secondary outcome measures. Among carriers of one or more apolipoprotein E epsilon4 alleles, the benefit of donepezil was evident throughout the three‐year follow‐up. There were no significant differences in the rate of progression to Alzheimer's disease between the vitamin E and placebo groups at any point, either among all patients or among apolipoprotein E epsilon4 carriers. CONCLUSIONS: Vitamin E had no benefit in patients with mild cognitive impairment. Although donepezil therapy was associated with a lower rate of progression to Alzheimer's disease during the first 12 months of treatment, the rate of progression to Alzheimer's disease after three years was not lower among patients treated with donepezil than among those given placebo.","352","23","2379‐2388","Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL)","PUBMED 15829527","EMBASE 40958434",,,,"Journal article","Alzheimer Disease [genetics, *prevention & control]; Apolipoprotein E4; Apolipoproteins E [genetics]; Cholinesterase Inhibitors [adverse effects, *therapeutic use]; Cognition Disorders [*drug therapy]; Disease Progression; Donepezil; Double‐Blind Method; Humans; Indans [adverse effects, *therapeutic use]; Nootropic Agents [adverse effects, therapeutic use]; Piperidines [adverse effects, *therapeutic use]; Proportional Hazards Models; Treatment Failure; Vitamin E [adverse effects, *therapeutic use]","10.1056/NEJMoa050151","https://www.cochranelibrary.com/central/doi/10.1002/central/CN-00515264/full","Dementia and Cognitive Improvement"

OBJECTIVE: To determine if vitamin E (alpha tocopherol), memantine, or both slow progression of mild to moderate AD in patients taking an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Double‐blind, placebo‐controlled, parallel‐group, randomized clinical trial involving 613 patients with mild to moderate AD initiated in August 2007 and concluded in September 2012 at 14 Veterans Affairs medical centers. INTERVENTIONS: Participants received either 2000 IU/d of alpha tocopherol (n = 152), 20 mg/d of memantine (n = 155), the combination (n = 154), or placebo (n = 152). MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study/Activities of Daily Living (ADCS‐ADL) Inventory score (range, 0‐78). Secondary outcomes included cognitive, neuropsychiatric, functional, and caregiver measures. RESULTS: Data from 561 participants were analyzed (alpha tocopherol = 140, memantine = 142, combination = 139, placebo = 140), with 52 excluded because of a lack of any follow‐up data. Over the mean (SD) follow‐up of 2.27 (1.22) years, ADCS‐ADL Inventory scores declined by 3.15 units (95% CI, 0.92 to 5.39; adjusted P = .03) less in the alpha tocopherol group compared with the placebo group. In the memantine group, these scores declined 1.98 units less (95% CI, ‐0.24 to 4.20; adjusted P = .40) than the placebo group's decline. This change in the alpha tocopherol group translates into a delay in clinical progression of 19% per year compared with placebo or a delay of approximately 6.2 months over the follow‐up period. Caregiver time increased least in the alpha tocopherol group. All‐cause mortality and safety analyses showed a difference only on the serious adverse event of ""infections or infestations,"" with greater frequencies in the memantine (31 events in 23 participants) and combination groups (44 events in 31 participants) compared with placebo (13 events in 11 participants). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Among patients with mild to moderate AD, 2000 IU/d of alpha tocopherol compared with placebo resulted in slower functional decline. There were no significant differences in the groups receiving memantine alone or memantine plus alpha tocopherol. These findings suggest benefit of alpha tocopherol in mild to moderate AD by slowing functional decline and decreasing caregiver burden.

In this study, we tested if vitamin E prevents oxidative stress and loss of cognition in AD. Fifty‐seven AD patients were recruited and divided in two groups: placebo or treated with 800 IU of vitamin E per day for six months. Of these 57 patients, only 33 finished the study. We measured blood oxidized glutathione (GSSG) and used the following cognitive tests: Mini‐Mental State Examination, Blessed‐Dementia Scale, and Clock Drawing Test. Of those patients treated with vitamin E, we found two groups. In the first group, ""respondents"" to vitamin E, GSSG levels were lower after the treatment and scores on the cognitive tests were maintained. The second group, ""non‐respondents"", consisted of patients in which vitamin E was not effective in preventing oxidative stress. In these patients, cognition decreased sharply, to levels even lower than those of patients taking placebo. Based on our findings, it appears that vitamin E lowers oxidative stress in some AD patients and maintains cognitive status, however, in those in which vitamin E does not prevent oxidative stress, it is detrimental in terms of cognition. Therefore, supplementation of AD patients with vitamin E cannot be recommended without determination of its antioxidant effect in each patient.","17","1","143‐149","Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL)","PUBMED 19494439",,,,,"Journal article","Alzheimer Disease [*complications, drug therapy]; Analysis of Variance; Arachidonic Acid [*therapeutic use]; Case‐Control Studies; Cognition Disorders [blood, *drug therapy, *etiology]; Double‐Blind Method; Glutathione Disulfide [blood]; Humans; Malondialdehyde [blood]; Mental Status Schedule; Neuropsychological Tests; Oxidative Stress [drug effects]; Prospective Studies; Statistics, Nonparametric","10.3233/JAD-2009-1033","https://www.cochranelibrary.com/central/doi/10.1002/central/CN-00703233/full","Dementia and Cognitive Improvement; Complementary Medicine"

A clinical trial was designed to compare the effectiveness of (i) alpha‐tocopherol, a vitamin E antioxidant; (ii) memantine (Namenda), an N‐methyl‐D‐aspartate antagonist; (iii) their combination; and (iv) placebo in delaying clinical progression in AD. METHODS: The Veterans Affairs Cooperative Studies Program initiated a multicenter, randomized, double‐blind, placebo‐controlled trial in August 2007, with enrollment through March 2012 and follow‐up continuing through September 2012. Participants with mild‐to‐moderate AD who were taking an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor were assigned randomly to 2000 IU/day of alpha‐tocopherol, 20 mg/day memantine, 2000 IU/day alpha‐tocopherol plus 20 mg/day memantine, or placebo. The primary outcome for the study is the Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study/Activities of Daily Living Inventory. Secondary outcome measures include the Mini‐Mental State Examination; the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale, cognitive portion; the Dependence Scale; the Neuropsychiatric Inventory; and the Caregiver Activity Survey. Patient follow‐up ranged from 6 months to 4 years. RESULTS: A total of 613 participants were randomized. The majority of the patients were male (97%) and white (86%), with a mean age of 79 years. The mean Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study/Activities of Daily Living Inventory score at entry was 57 and the mean Mini‐Mental State Examination score at entry was 21. CONCLUSION: This large multicenter trial will address the unanswered question of the long‐term safety and effectiveness of alpha‐tocopherol, memantine, and their combination in patients with mild‐to‐moderate AD taking an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor.
