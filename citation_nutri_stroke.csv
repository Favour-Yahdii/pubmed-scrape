Methods: Fifty‐one patients with severe stroke were randomly allocated into two groups with high protein enteral nutrition formula (EN was supplied as Fresubin 750 MCT, NPC:N = 100:1, n = 25) or standard enteral nutrition formula (EN was supplied as Nutrition Fibre, NPC:N = 130:1, n =26) respectively. They received equal non‐protein‐calorie (104.5 kJ · kg‐1 · d‐1) in all cases for 14 days. Results: Compared to standard nutritional supplementation, high protein nutritional supplementation was associated with a lower incidence of serum protein decrease, including total protein, albumin, and especially prealbumin in patients on the 7th day after stroke (P < 0.05). In the case of APACHE II > 19, incidence of hypoalbumemia was significantly lower in the high protein group during the 14 days after stroke (P < 0 05). Three‐month survival rate was similar between groups, but high protein group tended to have a higher one‐month survival rate. Conclusion: High protein enteral nutritional formula could reduce the risk of hypoalbumemia significantly in the patients with severe stroke. Thus high protein enteral nutrition is recommended to be used in severe stroke patients.","14","6","351‐355","Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL)",,"EMBASE 46043731",,,,"Journal article","*cerebrovascular accident; *enteric feeding; *hypoalbuminemia /complication /prevention /therapy; APACHE; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Article; Caloric intake; Clinical trial; Controlled clinical trial; Controlled study; Diet supplementation; Disease severity; Female; Human; Incidence; Intermethod comparison; Major clinical study; Male; Protein diet; Protein intake; Randomized controlled trial; Risk reduction; Survival rate; Treatment outcome",,"https://www.cochranelibrary.com/central/doi/10.1002/central/CN-00612679/full","Stroke"

Nutrition support is an essential element in the care of stroke patients and many studies have investigated the effect of specific nutritional elements on stroke patients. However, few studies have looked at the impact of complete enteral nutrition on Chinese patients with acute stroke. To investigate this, we conducted a randomized controlled trial of 146 patients with acute stroke and dysphagia, among whom 75 were supported with nasogastric nutrition and 71 received family managed nutrition after randomization. Nutritional status, nosocomial infection and mortality rates were recorded on day 21 of hospitalization. Neurological deficits were evaluated by the NIHSS activities of daily living Barthel index (ADLBI) and the modified Rankin scale (mRS) and compared between the two groups. We found that the nasogastric nutrition group had a better nutritional status and reduced nosocomial infection and mortality rates after 21 days compared with patients in the family managed nutrition group. In addition, the nasogastric nutrition group showed a lower score on the NIHSS than the control group. However, the differences in the scores of the ADLBI and the 90 day mRS between the groups were not significant. Taken together, the present study shows that early enteral nutrition support improves the short term prognosis of acute stroke patients with dysphagia.","22","9","1473‐1476","Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL)","PUBMED 26183306",,,,,"Journal article","Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Cross Infection [epidemiology]; Deglutition Disorders [etiology, *therapy]; Enteral Nutrition; Female; Hospitalization; Humans; Intubation, Gastrointestinal; Male; Middle Aged; Prognosis; Stroke [*complications]; United States","10.1016/j.jocn.2015.03.028","https://www.cochranelibrary.com/central/doi/10.1002/central/CN-01259337/full","Stroke"

Methods: Patients receiving EN from May 2017 to December 2018 in our department were enrolled and randomized into early (within 3 days after onset) feeding group (group E) and conventional (within 7 days after onset) feeding group (group L). Albumin, prealbumin, hemoglobin, upper arm muscle circumference (AMC), skin fold thickness (TSF), neurological function score were detected on day 1, 7, 14, 21 and 28. The incidence of infection and gastrointestinal complications were calculated. Results: The serum albumin levels of group E at day 21 were significantly higher than that of group L (P=0.025). The serum prealbumin levels of group E at day 14 were significantly higher than that of group L (P=0.003). For hemoglobin levels, no significant difference was observed between two groups (P>0.05 while the changes from admission to day 28 were significant within either group (P=0.0005). The difference of TSF and AMC values between two groups was not statistically significant (P>0.05) at any time point. The national institutes of health stroke scale (NIHSS) scores at day 14 showed significant difference between two groups (P=0.03) while none in Barthel index (P>0.05). Concerning clinical complications, diarrhea was more commonly observed in group E than group L (P=0.033) while incidence of pneumonia and urinary tract infection was comparable between groups. Conclusions: Early EN is safe and effective for patients with severe cerebrovascular disease, and can maintain nutritional indicator levels stable, such as serum albumin, serum prealbumin, and muscle and adipose tissue volume.

Methods: We conducted an eight‐wk, two‐parallel group intervention, randomized controlled, blinded outcome assessment among 44 post‐stroke older patients with sarcopenia. Sarcopenia was defined as a loss of skeletal muscle mass and decreased muscle strength according to the Asian Working Group for Sarcopenia criteria. The intervention group (n = 21) received a leucine‐enriched amino acid supplement; the control group (n = 23) did not. Both groups performed low‐intensity resistance training in addition to a post‐stroke rehabilitation program. A primary outcome of physical function by using the motor domain of Functional Independence Measure (FIM), and secondary outcomes of appendicular muscle mass (skeletal muscle mass index [SMI]) measured via bioelectrical impedance analysis and muscle strength as handgrip strength were measured at baseline and at the end of the intervention. Results: The FIM score increased significantly in both groups over time (P < 0.01), with significantly greater improvement in the intervention group than in the control group (P < 0.045). Handgrip strength also increased significantly over time (P <0.05), with significantly greater improvement in the intervention group (P < 0.01). The SMI increased significantly in the intervention group but not in the control group over time, with significantly greater improvement in the intervention group (median estimated difference, 0.50 kg/m2; 95% confidence interval, 0.01–2.11). Conclusions: We demonstrated that an eight‐wk intervention consisting of a leucine‐enriched amino acid supplementation and low‐intensity resistance training increased muscle mass, strength, and physical function in post‐stroke patients with sarcopenia.","58",,"1‐6","Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL)","PUBMED 30273819","EMBASE 2001141397",,,,"Journal article","*cerebrovascular accident /rehabilitation; *diet supplementation; *muscle mass; *muscle strength; *physical activity; *sarcopenia; Activities of Daily Living; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Article; Clinical article; Controlled study; Dietary Supplements; Female; Geriatric Assessment [methods]; Grip strength; Health Status; Human; Humans; Impedance; Leucine [administration & dosage, *pharmacology]; Male; Muscle Strength [*drug effects]; Muscle, Skeletal [*drug effects]; Open study; Outcome assessment; Parallel design; Priority journal; Randomized controlled trial; Resistance training; Sarcopenia [*complications]; Stroke Rehabilitation [*methods]; Stroke [complications]; Stroke rehabilitation; Treatment Outcome","10.1016/j.nut.2018.05.028","https://www.cochranelibrary.com/central/doi/10.1002/central/CN-01650094/full","Stroke"

Journal of parenteral and enteral nutrition","2006","BACKGROUND: Evidence shows that there is a rapid increase in the production of markers of oxidative damage immediately after acute ischemic stroke and that endogenous antioxidant defenses are rapidly depleted, thus permitting further tissue damage. Several studies point to an antioxidant effect of B‐group vitamins and a pro‐oxidant effect of elevated total plasma homocysteine (tHcy). METHODS: To test whether supplementary antioxidants with or without B‐group vitamins during this critical period enhance antioxidant capacity or mitigate oxidative damage, ninety‐six acute ischemic stroke patients within 12 hours of symptom onset were randomly assigned to receive either daily oral 800 IU (727 mg) vitamin E and 500 mg vitamin C (n = 24), or B‐group vitamins (5 mg folic acid, 5 mg vitamin B(2), 50 mg vitamin B(6), and 0.4 mg of vitamin B(12); n = 24), both vitamins together (n = 24), or no supplementation (n = 24) for 14 days. Treatment groups and controls were matched for stroke subtype and age. Blood was obtained before treatment, at day 7, and day 14 for measurements of plasma or blood vitamin status, plasma total antioxidant capacity (TAOC), malondialdehyde (MDA), tHcy and C‐reactive protein (CRP). RESULTS: Supplementation with antioxidant vitamins and B‐group vitamins separately or together significantly increased the plasma concentration of vitamin C, E, pyridoxal phosphate (B(6) status), red blood cell folate, and improved a measure of B(2) status (red cell glutathione reductase activation coefficient [EGRAC]), compared with the control group. Plasma TAOC increased significantly in the antioxidant treatment groups compared with the nonsignificant decline seen in the control group. tHcy concentrations decreased in subjects who received B‐group vitamins and the control group compared with the rise seen in those who received antioxidants alone. There was a significant reduction in plasma MDA concentration in the 3 treatment groups, in contrast to the increase seen in the control group; however, the changes were most evident in antioxidant groups. CRP concentrations (a marker of tissue inflammation) were significantly lower in the 3 treatment groups compared with the control group. There were no additive or synergistic effects of antioxidants and B‐group vitamins together on any outcome measure. CONCLUSIONS: Antioxidants supplementation with or without B‐group vitamins enhances antioxidant capacity, mitigates oxidative damage, and may have an anti‐inflammatory effect immediately postinfarct in stroke disease.","30","2","108‐114","Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL)","PUBMED 16517955","EMBASE 44314784",,,,"Journal article","*antioxidant/cb [Drug Combination]; *antioxidant/cm [Drug Comparison]; *antioxidant/ct [Clinical Trial]; *antioxidant/pd [Pharmacology]; *antioxidant/po [Oral Drug Administration]; *cerebrovascular accident; *vitamin B complex/cb [Drug Combination]; *vitamin B complex/cm [Drug Comparison]; *vitamin B complex/ct [Clinical Trial]; *vitamin B complex/pd [Pharmacology]; *vitamin B complex/po [Oral Drug Administration]; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Alpha tocopherol/cb [Drug Combination]; Alpha tocopherol/cm [Drug Comparison]; Alpha tocopherol/ct [Clinical Trial]; Alpha tocopherol/ec [Endogenous Compound]; Alpha tocopherol/pd [Pharmacology]; Alpha tocopherol/po [Oral Drug Administration]; Antiinflammatory activity; Antioxidant activity; Antioxidants [*administration & dosage]; Anti‐Inflammatory Agents; Article; Ascorbic Acid [administration & dosage, blood]; Ascorbic acid/cb [Drug Combination]; Ascorbic acid/cm [Drug Comparison]; Ascorbic acid/ct [Clinical Trial]; Ascorbic acid/ec [Endogenous Compound]; Ascorbic acid/pd [Pharmacology]; Ascorbic acid/po [Oral Drug Administration]; Biochemical marker/ec [Endogenous Compound]; C reactive protein/ec [Endogenous Compound]; Clinical trial; Controlled clinical trial; Controlled study; Cyanocobalamin/cb [Drug Combination]; Cyanocobalamin/cm [Drug Comparison]; Cyanocobalamin/ct [Clinical Trial]; Cyanocobalamin/pd [Pharmacology]; Cyanocobalamin/po [Oral Drug Administration]; C‐Reactive Protein [analysis]; Dietary Supplements; Enzyme activation; Erythrocyte level; Female; Folic Acid [administration & dosage, blood]; Folic acid/cb [Drug Combination]; Folic acid/cm [Drug Comparison]; Folic acid/ct [Clinical Trial]; Folic acid/ec [Endogenous Compound]; Folic acid/pd [Pharmacology]; Folic acid/po [Oral Drug Administration]; Glutathione reductase/ec [Endogenous Compound]; Homocysteine [blood]; Homocysteine/ec [Endogenous Compound]; Human; Humans; Inflammation; Major clinical study; Male; Malonaldehyde/ec [Endogenous Compound]; Malondialdehyde [blood]; Oxidative Stress; Oxidative stress; Priority journal; Pyridoxal 5 phosphate/ec [Endogenous Compound]; Pyridoxine/cb [Drug Combination]; Pyridoxine/cm [Drug Comparison]; Pyridoxine/ct [Clinical Trial]; Pyridoxine/pd [Pharmacology]; Pyridoxine/po [Oral Drug Administration]; Randomized controlled trial; Riboflavin [administration & dosage, blood]; Riboflavin/cb [Drug Combination]; Riboflavin/cm [Drug Comparison]; Riboflavin/ct [Clinical Trial]; Riboflavin/pd [Pharmacology]; Riboflavin/po [Oral Drug Administration]; Stroke [*therapy]; Vitamin B 12 [administration & dosage, blood]; Vitamin B 6 [administration & dosage, blood]; Vitamin B Complex [*administration & dosage]; Vitamin E [administration & dosage, blood]; Vitamin blood level","10.1177/0148607106030002108","https://www.cochranelibrary.com/central/doi/10.1002/central/CN-00563089/full","Complementary Medicine; Stroke"
"CN-00617709","Gariballa, S; Ullegaddi, R","Riboflavin status in acute ischaemic stroke","European journal of clinical nutrition","2007","BACKGROUND: There is experimental evidence that riboflavin (vitamin B2) supplementation reduces oxidative damage and cerebral oedema following acute stroke. OBJECTIVE: To measure riboflavin levels in acute stroke before and after supplementation with this vitamin. DESIGN: Ninety‐six acute ischaemic stroke patients had their riboflavin status measured at baseline and then randomly assigned to receive 5 mg of oral riboflavin and other B‐group vitamins within 12 h of the stroke onset and then daily or no B‐vitamins for 14 days. Non‐fasting venous blood was obtained at baseline, days 7 and 14 post‐randomization for measurement of riboflavin status using erythrocyte glutathione reductase activity coefficient (EGRAC). EGRAC is a measure of riboflavin tissue saturation. This assay has the advantage of being extremely stable and sensitive. EGRAC values are inversely proportional to riboflavin status, so that values greater than 1.3 indicate biochemical deficiency. RESULTS: Fifty‐one per cent of patients studied were riboflavin deficient at baseline. Fourteen days of riboflavin supplementation significantly improved the measure of B2 status compared with the control group. Seven out of 37 patients in the supplement group (19%) were riboflavin deficient compared with 22 out of 39 patients (56%) in the control group at the end of the treatment period (P=0.035 for the differences in cumulative changes between groups over 2 weeks). CONCLUSIONS: A high proportion of acute stroke patients were biochemically deficient of riboflavin immediately post‐infarct. Supplementation with 5 mg of riboflavin for 2 weeks significantly improved riboflavin status; however, the clinical significance of these findings is not yet known.","61","10","1237‐1240","Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL)","PUBMED 17299470",,,,,"Journal article","Acute Disease; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Analysis of Variance; Dietary Supplements; Erythrocytes [enzymology]; Female; Glutathione Reductase [metabolism]; Humans; Male; Nutritional Status; Oxidative Stress [*drug effects]; Prevalence; Riboflavin Deficiency [*drug therapy, epidemiology]; Riboflavin [*blood, *therapeutic use]; Stroke [*blood]; Vitamin B Complex [blood, therapeutic use]","10.1038/sj.ejcn.1602666","https://www.cochranelibrary.com/central/doi/10.1002/central/CN-00617709/full","Stroke"

The association between low serum levels of 25‐hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH) D) and increased risk of depression is reported in both stroke and non‐stroke patients. Similarly, high 25(OH) D levels might be associated with greater functional improvement during rehabilitation program.We wanted to investigate the effects of an intensive rehabilitation on poststroke outcomes. We wondered if the daily rehabilitation of motor and cognitive functions could also have an effect on mood and functional abilities in addition to or as an alternative to vitamin D supplementation.We conducted a 12‐week, randomized trial, double blind, parallel, monocentric clinical trial of 40 patients undergoing intensive neuro‐rehabilitation treatment at a specialized care facility for ischemic or hemorrhagic brain stroke. Participants were randomly assigned, in a 1:1 ratio, to 1 of 2 parallel groups: in the experimental group, 2000 IU/day of oral cholecalciferol was administered; in the control group patients were not taking vitamin D supplementation. Patients underwent a text evaluation to investigate psychological and motor outcomes.Significant intra‐group difference in outcomes measures was found but not between control group and experimental group. In the vitamin D group, we highlighted significant differences between T0 and T1 in calcium (P < .001), vitamin D (P < .001), in Montgomery Aasberg Depression Rating Scale (P = .001), and in Functional Independent Measures (P < .001).

However the utility of homocysteine‐lowering therapy to reduce that risk has not been confirmed by randomized trials. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether high doses of folic acid, pyridoxine (vitamin B6), and cobalamin (vitamin B12), given to lower total homocysteine levels, reduce the risk of recurrent stroke over a 2‐year period compared with low doses of these vitamins. DESIGN: Double‐blind randomized controlled trial (September 1996‐May 2003). SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: 3680 adults with nondisabling cerebral infarction at 56 university‐affiliated hospitals, community hospitals, private neurology practices, and Veterans Affairs medical centers across the United States, Canada, and Scotland. INTERVENTIONS: All participants received best medical and surgical care plus a daily multivitamin containing the US Food and Drug Administration's reference daily intakes of other vitamins; patients were randomly assigned to receive once‐daily doses of the high‐dose formulation (n = 1827), containing 25 mg of pyridoxine, 0.4 mg of cobalamin, and 2.5 mg of folic acid; or the low‐dose formulation (n = 1853), containing 200 microg of pyridoxine, 6 microg of cobalamin and 20 microg of folic acid. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Recurrent cerebral infarction (primary outcome); coronary heart disease (CHD) events and death (secondary outcomes). RESULTS: Mean reduction of total homocysteine was 2 micromol/L greater in the high‐dose group than in the low‐dose group, but there was no treatment effect on any end point. The unadjusted risk ratio for any stroke, CHD event, or death was 1.0 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.8‐1.1), with chances of an event within 2 years of 18.0% in the high‐dose group and 18.6% in the low‐dose group. The risk of ischemic stroke within 2 years was 9.2% for the high‐dose and 8.8% for the low‐dose groups (risk ratio, 1.0; 95% CI, 0.8‐1.3) (P =.80 by log‐rank test of the primary hypothesis of difference in ischemic stroke between treatment groups). There was a persistent and graded association between baseline total homocysteine level and outcomes. A 3‐ micromol/L lower total homocysteine level was associated with a 10% lower risk of stroke (P =.05), a 26% lower risk of CHD events (P<.001), and a 16% lower risk of death (P =.001) in the low‐dose group and a nonsignificantly lower risk in the high‐dose group by 2% for stroke, 7% for CHD events, and 7% for death. CONCLUSIONS: In this trial, moderate reduction of total homocysteine after nondisabling cerebral infarction had no effect on vascular outcomes during the 2 years of follow‐up. However, the consistent findings of an association of total homocysteine with vascular risk suggests that further exploration of the hypothesis is warranted and longer trials in different populations with elevated total homocysteine may be necessary.","291","5","565‐575","Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL)","PUBMED 14762035",,,,,"Journal article","Adult; Aged; Coronary Disease [blood, prevention & control]; Double‐Blind Method; Female; Folic Acid [administration & dosage, *therapeutic use]; Homocysteine [*blood]; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Myocardial Infarction [blood, prevention & control]; Recurrence; Risk; Stroke [*blood, *prevention & control]; Treatment Outcome; Vitamin B 12 [administration & dosage, *therapeutic use]; Vitamin B 6 [administration & dosage, *therapeutic use]","10.1001/jama.291.5.565","https://www.cochranelibrary.com/central/doi/10.1002/central/CN-00460219/full","Stroke; Heart; Complementary Medicine"

In order to measure the effects of these therapies it will be necessary to measure atherosclerosis. Elevated levels of plasma total homocysteine (tHcy) are associated with increased risk of stroke and myocardial infarction. Measurement of the effect of vitamin therapy on atherosclerosis has therefore been used as an example of this approach. METHODS: 2‐Dimensional measurement of carotid plaque cross‐sectional area has been used to measure effects of vitamin therapy in patients whose plaque is progressing despite intensive treatment of traditional risk factors. In clinic patients, addition of vitamin therapy halted progression of atherosclerosis, in samples of 50 patients over 2.5 years. However, in patients randomized to high‐dose vs. low‐dose vitamins in the Vitamin Intervention for Stroke Prevention trial, no difference in plaque progression was seen between high‐dose and low‐dose vitamin therapy. New methods have been developed for the measurement of 3‐dimensional plaque volume, and for the measurement of plaque surface roughness. RESULTS: The accuracy and reliability of the measurement of plaque volume is 95%. This will permit measurement of effects of new anti‐atherosclerotic therapies with much smaller sample sizes, in a much shorter time, than previously available methods such as intima‐media thickness. CONCLUSION: Measurement of atherosclerotic plaque volume and roughness will greatly enhance the study of new anti‐atherosclerotic therapies.","41","11","1498‐1504","Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL)","PUBMED 14656032","EMBASE 37493567",,,,"Journal article","*coronary artery atherosclerosis/di [Diagnosis]; *coronary artery atherosclerosis/dt [Drug Therapy]; *cyanocobalamin/cb [Drug Combination]; *cyanocobalamin/do [Drug Dose]; *cyanocobalamin/dt [Drug Therapy]; *cyanocobalamin/pd [Pharmacology]; *folic acid/cb [Drug Combination]; *folic acid/do [Drug Dose]; *folic acid/dt [Drug Therapy]; *folic acid/pd [Pharmacology]; *homocysteine/ec [Endogenous Compound]; *pyridoxine/cb [Drug Combination]; *pyridoxine/do [Drug Dose]; *pyridoxine/dt [Drug Therapy]; *pyridoxine/pd [Pharmacology]; Accuracy; Aged; Amino acid blood level; Artery intima proliferation; Artery media; Article; Atherosclerotic plaque/di [Diagnosis]; Atherosclerotic plaque/dt [Drug Therapy]; Carotid Stenosis [blood, *diagnostic imaging, drug therapy]; Clinical article; Clinical trial; Controlled clinical trial; Controlled study; Dose‐Response Relationship, Drug; Drug megadose; Folic Acid [administration & dosage, therapeutic use]; Heart infarction; Homocysteine [*blood]; Human; Humans; Imaging, Three‐Dimensional; Low drug dose; Measurement; Methodology; Priority journal; Randomized controlled trial; Reliability; Reproducibility of Results; Risk factor; Sample size; Stroke [blood, *prevention & control]; Stroke/dt [Drug Therapy]; Stroke/pc [Prevention]; Time; Ultrasonography; Vitamin B 12 [administration & dosage, therapeutic use]; Vitamin B 6 [administration & dosage, therapeutic use]; Vitamins [administration & dosage, *therapeutic use]","10.1515/CCLM.2003.230","https://www.cochranelibrary.com/central/doi/10.1002/central/CN-00459316/full","Stroke; Complementary Medicine"

Reasons for lack of efficacy may have included folate fortification of grain products, inclusion of the recommended daily intake for B12 in the low‐dose arm, treatment with parenteral B12 in patients with low B12 levels in both study arms, a dose of B12 too low for patients with malabsorption, supplementation with nonstudy vitamins, and failure of patients with significant renal impairment to respond to vitamin therapy. We conducted an efficacy analysis limited to patients most likely to benefit from the treatment, based on hypotheses arising from evidence developed since VISP was initiated. The criteria for this subgroup were defined before any data analysis. METHODS: For this analysis, we excluded patients with low and very high B12 levels at baseline (<250 and >637 pmol/L, representing the 25th and 95th percentiles), to exclude those likely to have B12 malabsorption or to be taking B12 supplements outside the study and patients with significant renal impairment (glomerular filtration rate <46.18; the 10th percentile). RESULTS: This subgroup represents 2155 patients (37% female), with a mean age of 66+/‐10.7 years. For the combined end point of ischemic stroke, coronary disease, or death, there was a 21% reduction in the risk of events in the high‐dose group compared with the low‐dose group (unadjusted P=0.049; adjusted for age, sex, blood pressure, smoking, and B12 level P=0.056). In Kaplan‐Meier survival analysis comparing 4 groups, patients with a baseline B12 level at the median or higher randomized to high‐dose vitamin had the best overall outcome, and those with B12 less than the median assigned to low‐dose vitamin had the worst (P=0.02 for combined stroke, death, and coronary events; P=0.03 for stroke and coronary events). CONCLUSIONS: In the era of folate fortification, B12 plays a key role in vitamin therapy for total homocysteine. Higher doses of B12, and other treatments to lower total homocysteine may be needed for some patients.","36","11","2404‐2409","Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL)","PUBMED 16239629","EMBASE 41566967",,,,"Journal article","*cerebrovascular accident /drug therapy /prevention; *vitamin supplementation; Adult; Aged; Article; Blood pressure; Clinical trial; Controlled clinical trial; Controlled study; Coronary artery disease; Data analysis; Death; Disease‐Free Survival; Double blind procedure; Drug efficacy; Drug megadose; Evidence based medicine; Female; Folic Acid [metabolism]; Glomerular Filtration Rate; Glomerulus filtration rate; Homocysteine [chemistry]; Human; Humans; Ischemia [pathology]; Kaplan Meier method; Low drug dose; Major clinical study; Malabsorption; Male; Middle Aged; Models, Statistical; Priority journal; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic; Randomized controlled trial; Risk reduction; Smoking; Stroke [*drug therapy, pathology, *prevention & control, therapy]; Survival; Time Factors; Treatment Outcome; Treatment failure; Treatment outcome; Vitamin B 12 [metabolism]; Vitamins [metabolism, *therapeutic use]","10.1161/01.STR.0000185929.38534.f3","https://www.cochranelibrary.com/central/doi/10.1002/central/CN-01759826/full",

We tested a novel therapeutic approach with long‐chain omega‐3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (n‐3 PUFAs) to assess the safety and feasibility of an effectiveness trial. Methods: We conducted a multicentre, parallel, randomized, open‐label pilot trial. Patients admitted within 72 hours after SAH with modified Fisher scale scores of 3 or 4 who were selected for scheduled aneurysm clipping were allocated to receive either n‐3 PUFA treatment (parenteral perioperative: 5 days; oral: 8 weeks) plus usual care or usual care alone. Exploratory outcome measures included major postoperative intracranial bleeding complications (PIBCs), cerebral infarction caused by delayed cerebral ischemia, shunt‐dependent hydrocephalus, and consent rate. The computed tomography evaluator was blinded to the group assignment. Results: Forty‐one patients were randomized, but one patient had to be excluded after allocation. Twenty patients remained for intention to treat analysis in each trial arm. No PIBs (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.00 to 0.16) or other unexpected harm were observed in the intervention group (IG). No patient suspended the intervention due to side effects. There was a trend towards improvements in all benefit‐related outcomes in the IG. The overall consent rate was 0.91 (95% CI: 0.78 to 0.96), and there was no consent withdrawal. Conclusions: Although the balance between the benefit and harm of the intervention appears highly favourable, further testing on SAH patients is required.

We therefore tested whether intensive nutritional supplements given to undernourished patients from the time of their admission to a specialized stroke rehabilitation service would improve patient outcomes. METHODS: Randomized, prospective, double‐blind, single center study comparing intensive nutritional supplementation to routine nutritional supplementation in 116 undernourished patients admitted to a stroke service. The analysis included the 90% of patients who were not lost to follow‐up due to acute or subacute hospitalization (n = 102; 51 in each group). The nutritional supplements are commercially available and Food and Drug Administration approved. The primary outcome variable was change in total score on the Functional Independence Measure (FIM). The secondary outcome measurements included the FIM motor and cognitive subscores, length of stay (taken from day of admission), 2‐minute and 6‐minute timed walk tests measured at admission and on discharge, and discharge disposition (home/not home). RESULTS: Patients receiving intensive nutritional supplementation improved more than those on standard nutritional supplements on measures of motor function (total FIM, FIM motor subscore, 2‐minute and 6‐minute timed walk tests, all significant at p < 0.002). They did not, however, improve on measures of cognition (FIM cognition score). A higher proportion of patients who received the intensive nutritional supplementation went home compared to those on standard supplementation (p = 0.05).

In this trial, we assessed whether treatment with a guideline‐recommended moderate‐dose fish oil supplement could improve cardiovascular biomarkers, mood‐ and health‐related quality of life in patients with ischemic stroke. METHODS: Patients with CT‐confirmed stroke were randomized to 3 g/day encapsulated fish oil containing approximately 1.2 g total omega‐3 (0.7 g docosahexaenoic acid; 0.3 g eicosapentaenoic acid) or placebo oil (combination palm and soy) taken daily over 12 weeks. Serum triglycerides, total cholesterol and associated lipoproteins, selected inflammatory and hemostatic markers, mood, and health‐related quality of life were assessed at baseline and follow‐up. The primary outcome was change in triglycerides. Compliance was assessed by capsule count and serum phospholipid omega‐3 levels (Australian Clinical Trials Registration: ACTRN12605000207617). RESULTS: One hundred two patients were randomized to fish oil or placebo. Intention‐to‐treat and per‐protocol (>85% compliance) analyses showed no significant effect of fish oil treatment on any lipid, inflammatory, hemostatic, or composite mood parameters measured. Adherence to treatment based on pill count was good (89%) reflected by increased serum docosahexanoic acid (P<0.001) and eicosapentaenoic acid (P=0.0006) in the fish oil group. Analysis of oil composition, however, showed some degradation and potentially adverse oxidation products at the end of the study. CONCLUSIONS: There was no effect of 12 weeks of treatment with moderate‐dose fish oil supplements on cardiovascular biomarkers or mood in patients with ischemic stroke. It is possible that insufficient dose, short duration of treatment, and/or oxidation of the fish oils may have influenced these outcomes.","40","11","3485‐3492","Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL)","PUBMED 19745175",,,,,"Journal article","Affect [drug effects]; Aged; Brain Ischemia [complications, *diet therapy, psychology]; Cardiovascular Diseases [etiology, *prevention & control, psychology]; Double‐Blind Method; Fatty Acids, Omega‐3 [*administration & dosage]; Female; Fish Oils [*administration & dosage]; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Risk Factors; Stroke [complications, *diet therapy, psychology]; Treatment Outcome","10.1161/STROKEAHA.109.555136","https://www.cochranelibrary.com/central/doi/10.1002/central/CN-00732082/full","Complementary Medicine; Dementia and Cognitive Improvement; Stroke"

Management measures to improve neurologic outcomes are in great need. Our previous intervention trial in elderly subjects successfully used salt as a carrier for potassium, demonstrating a 41% reduction in cardiovascular mortality by switching to potassium‐enriched salt. Dietary magnesium has been associated with lowered diabetes and/or stroke risk in humans and with neuroprotection in animals.Objective: Because a large proportion of Taiwanese individuals are in marginal deficiency states for potassium and for magnesium and salt is a good carrier for minerals, it is justifiable to study whether further enriching salt with magnesium at an amount near the Dietary Reference Intake (DRI) amount may provide additional benefit for stroke recovery.Design: This was a double‐blind, randomized controlled trial comprising 291 discharged stroke patients with modified Rankin scale (mRS) ≤4. There were 3 arms: 1) regular salt (Na salt) (n = 99), 2) potassium‐enriched salt (K salt) (n = 97), and 3) potassium‐ and magnesium‐enriched salt (K/Mg salt) (n = 95). The NIH Stroke Scale (NIHSS), Barthel Index (BI), and mRS were evaluated at discharge, at 3 mo, and at 6 mo. A good neurologic performance was defined by NIHSS = 0, BI = 100, and mRS ≤1.Results: After the 6‐mo intervention, the proportion of patients with good neurologic performance increased in a greater magnitude in the K/Mg salt group than in the K salt group and the Na salt group, in that order. The K/Mg salt group had a significantly increased OR (2.25; 95% CI: 1.09, 4.67) of achieving good neurologic performance compared with the Na salt group. But the effect of K salt alone (OR: 1.58; 95% CI: 0.77, 3.22) was not significant.Conclusions: This study suggests that providing the DRI amount of magnesium and potassium together long term is beneficial for stroke patient recovery from neurologic deficits.

"CN-02347952","Ogawa, K","Effect of enteral nutrition with eicosapentaenoic acids for prevention of bedsores in cerebrovascular disease patients","Clinical nutrition ESPEN","2021","Rationale: In cases with severely impaired consciousness due to cerebrovascular diseases, patients must go through therapy under hospitalization for several days, and are at risk of bedsores due to long‐term bed rest during thrapeutical period. If bedsores could be prevented by feeding an enteral diet enriched with EPA, it can be supposed that this diet therapy might make a contribution to improvement of aspects of clinical care and reduction of clinical costs. Methods: The study was conducted as a prospective randomized controlled trial. Twenty patients were administrated. Ages ranged from 55 to 85 years of age. The breakdown of the patients was cerebrovascular infarction. Patients showing critically impaired consciousness with GCS scores of 12 or less for whom four or more days of bed rest had been prescribed were randomly allocated into two groups: one to be given the enteral diet enriched with EPA, and the other to be fed with an isonitrogenous and isocaloric control diet. All patients were evaluated regarding the incidence frequency of bedsores based on DESIGN‐R. Results: Investigation on changes in CRP, an inflammatory index, showed more significant suppression of inflammation in the EPA enriched diet group when compared to the control group. Regarding new occurrence of bedsores, no lesion was observed in the EPA enriched diet group, showing apparently lower incidence of bedsores compared to the control group, in which one new lesion on day 4, one new lesion on day 7 and one new lesion on day 14 were observed. Conclusion: It was considered that nutritional management of our study showed that EPA enriched enteral diets suppressed inflammation and improved low nutrition and using EPA enriched enteral diets could be a useful option for prevention of bedsores in patients who need long‐term immobile bed rest. This nutritional management clarified that a proper choice of enteral diet makes it possible to save hours of clinical care and medical costs due to prevention of bedsores.

However, it is not clear whether post‐stroke vitamin D supplementation can improve these outcomes. In this study, we investigated the effects of vitamin D supplementation on outcomes in hospitalized patients undergoing rehabilitation after acute stroke. A multicenter, randomized, controlled, double‐blind, parallel‐group trial was conducted from January 2012 through July 2017. One hundred patients admitted to a convalescent rehabilitation ward after having an acute stroke were randomized, and each one received either vitamin D3 (2000 IU/day) or a placebo. The primary outcome was a gain in the Barthel Index scores at week 8. Secondary outcomes were seen in Barthel Index efficiency, hand grip strength, and calf circumference at week 8. Ninety‐seven patients completed the study. There were no significant differences in the demographic characteristics between the groups.

Therefore, the aim of this study was to determine the effect of vitamin A and D combination supplement on interleukin‐1β (IL‐1β) and clinical outcome in ischemic stroke. Methods A single‐blind, randomized controlled trial was conducted on ischemic stroke patients at Adam Malik Hospital between March 2018 to February 2019. The patients were randomized into 4 groups of the treatment consisting of supplementation using vitamin A or D only, combination of vitamin A and D, and placebo group, all given for 12 weeks. Clinical outcome was determined using the National Institute of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS). At the time of admission and after the treatment was completed, all patients were measured for vitamin A, vitamin D, and IL‐1β serum level, and NIHSS score. Results From the total of 120 patients, in the combination group there were significant increments on both vitamin A (p=0.04) and vitamin D (p=0.01) serum level after 12 weeks of the treatment, compared to the other groups. In conjunction, IL‐1β serum level showed a significant decrement in the combination group (p<0.001). Lastly, the biggest improvement of NIHSS could be seen in the combination group, which was marked by the highest decrement of NIHSS score (p<0.001).

Weight control thus seems to be important after stroke, and methods for monitoring nutritional status need to be simple and non‐invasive. Here we aimed to assess if the nutritional intervention altered body composition in men and women in this study cohort, and also to examine the correlation between the methods for assessing body‐, fat‐ and fat‐free mass. METHODS: Acute stroke patients > 65 years at nutritional risk were randomized to either individualized, nutritional treatment with energy‐ and protein rich supplementation (intervention, n = 58) or routine, nutritional care (control, n = 66) while in hospital. Body composition was assessed with anthropometry and bioelectrical impedance. The follow‐up period was three months. RESULTS: During the first week while in hospital, weight loss was smaller in the intervention group compared with the controls (P = 0.013). After three months weight‐ and fat loss were significant in both men and women. Whereas no significant differences were found in changes in body composition between the male study groups, in the women both weight loss (P = 0.022) and fat loss (P = 0.005) was smaller in the intervention group compared with the controls. A high correlation (r = 0.87) between mid upper arm circumference (MUAC) and body mass index (BMI) was found. CONCLUSIONS: Individualized nutritional support to older stroke patients in hospital was beneficial for maintaining an adequate body mass and body composition the first week and seemed to have a preventive effect on fat loss among women, but not among men after three months. Measurement of MUAC may be used in the assessment of nutritional status when BMI cannot be obtained.

Hence the patient's nutritional status often deteriorates while in hospital and after discharge. Undernourished patients have poorer outcome and shorter survival after an acute stroke. It is, however, unclear if nutritional intervention will benefit these patients. Thus we have examined whether individualised nutritional supplementation improves quality of life (QoL) in this patient group. Methods Acute stroke patients >65 years were examined with the Malnutrition Universal Screening Tool ('MUST') shortly after hospital admission. Undernourished patients and those at risk of undernourishment were eligible for inclusion. The patients were randomised to either standard care or to individualised nutritional supplementation during their hospital stay. The daily supplementation consisted of enriched meals, sip feedings or tube feeding. To assess QoL we interviewed the patients using the EuroQoL EQ‐5D questionnaire. The interview was performed shortly before hospital discharge and after 3 months. Results A total of 165 patients were included, and 78 completed the study at 3 month follow‐up. Complete data on QoL was not obtained in 36 patients and the remaining either died (22) or were lost to follow‐up (19). Mean (SD) age was 80.0 (7.3) years in the control group (n=43) and 77.1 (7.7) years in the intervention group (n=35). Compared to baseline the intervention group scored less at 3 months on the EQ‐5D descriptive part in 3 out of 5 dimensions: mobility (p=0.007), self‐care (p=0.005) and usual activities (p=0.012), indicating improvement in their daily functions. In contrast, these scores did not change significantly in the control group. There were no significant differences in scores for the dimensions “anxiety or depression” or for “discomfort or pain” in either group. On the VAS scale, with rating of current self‐perceived health state, the baseline values were similar (p=0.27) in both groups. The intervention group had a substantial improvement in health‐related VAS score at 3 months compared with baseline (p=0.007) and compared with the controls: 13.0 (26.8) and 1.9 (23.4) (p=0.009), respectively. Conclusion In undernourished elderly patients and those at risk of poor nutritional state, individual nutritional therapy while in hospital improved QoL 3 months after onset of acute stroke.","40","4","e237‐e238","Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL)",,"EMBASE 70014828",,,,"Journal article; Conference proceeding","*aged; *cerebrovascular accident; *nursing; *quality of life; *randomized controlled trial; *supplementation; Anxiety; Control group; Feeding tube; Follow up; Health; Health status; Hospital; Hospital admission; Hospital discharge; Hospitalization; Interview; Malnutrition; Nutritional status; Pain; Patient; Questionnaire; Risk; Screening; Self care; Stroke patient; Survival; Therapy",,"https://www.cochranelibrary.com/central/doi/10.1002/central/CN-01785595/full",

Observational studies have reported an association of low vitamin D levels with greater stroke severity, poststroke mortality and functional disability. Randomised clinical trials are lacking. We sought to assess the effect of calcium and vitamin D supplementation in ischaemic stroke survivors with vitamin D deficiency/insufficiency on disability/mortality outcomes. METHODS: In this randomised controlled open‐label trial, 73 patients of acute ischaemic stroke were screened for serum 25 hydroxy Vitamin D (25(OH)D) levels. A total of 53 patients with baseline 25(OH)D <75 nmol/L were randomised into two arms. One received vitamin D and calcium supplementation along with usual care (n=25) and the other received usual care alone (n=28). Primary outcome was the proportion of patients achieving a good outcome [modified Rankin Scale score 0‐2] at 6 months and all cause mortality at 6 months. RESULTS: The age (mean±SD) of participants was 60.4±11.3 years, 69.8% were males. The proportion of patients achieving good outcome was higher in the intervention arm (Adjusted OR 1.9, 95% CI 0.6‐6.4; P=.31).

AIM: To examine the feasibility of enteral sip feeding as an effective nutrition intervention after acute stroke. METHODS: Forty‐two acute ischemic stroke inpatients with impaired nutritional status who did not have difficulty swallowing within 1 week after the stroke were entered into a single‐blind, randomized, controlled, prospective study of enteral sip feeding. Twenty‐one patients were randomized to receive daily oral food supplements for 4 weeks in addition to the hospital food, and 21 patients received only the hospital food for the same period. Main outcome measures were energy and protein intakes during the intervention period, change in nutritional status, disability, infective complications, length of stay, and mortality during hospitalization and at 3 months. RESULTS: Two patients, one from each group, were lost to follow‐up immediately after randomization. Twenty patients received oral nutritional supplementation. The energy intake was significantly greater in the supplemented group: 1807 +/‐ 318 vs 1084 +/‐ 343 kcal/d (mean +/‐ SD; p < .0001) (estimated treatment effect, 723 kcal/d; 95% confidence interval [CI], 498 to 947), as was protein intake: 65.1 +/‐ 13.8 vs 44.1 +/‐ 12.8 g/d (p < .001) (estimated treatment effect, 21.0 g/d; 95% CI, 11.7 to 30.3).

Results from the Nutristroke Trial","Cerebrovascular diseases (Basel, Switzerland)","2009","BACKGROUND: To test whether supplementary antioxidants and n‐3 fatty acids, alone or in combination, could improve functional status in stroke survivors. METHODS: We performed a randomized, double‐blind, placebo‐controlled clinical trial in 72 stroke patients (47 males; age 65.3 +/‐ 12.9 years) admitted to a rehabilitation hospital for sequelae of first‐ever ischemic stroke, and divided them into 4 subgroups. Group 1 patients received daily oral antioxidants, group 2 received n‐3 polyunsaturated fatty acids, group 3 both supplements, and group 4 placebo, all for 12 months. No difference at baseline was observed among groups in neurological severity or in disability. All measures were repeated after 6 and 12 months of treatment. All major clinical events were recorded. RESULTS: At baseline, 25% of the patients had a low plasma vitamin status, and 48.5% was at risk of undernutrition. At the 1‐year follow‐up, we observed a trend for lower mortality (p = 0.060) in subgroups treated with n‐3 fatty acids, but without significant differences in rehabilitation result status among groups.

We aimed to establish whether the timing and route of enteral tube feeding after stroke affected patients' outcomes at 6 months. METHODS: The FOOD trials consist of three pragmatic multicentre randomised controlled trials, two of which included dysphagic stroke patients. In one trial, patients enrolled within 7 days of admission were randomly allocated to early enteral tube feeding or no tube feeding for more than 7 days (early versus avoid). In the other, patients were allocated percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) or nasogastric feeding. The primary outcome was death or poor outcome at 6 months. Analysis was by intention to treat. FINDINGS: Between Nov 1, 1996, and July 31, 2003, 859 patients were enrolled by 83 hospitals in 15 countries into the early versus avoid trial. Early tube feeding was associated with an absolute reduction in risk of death of 5.8% (95% CI ‐0.8 to 12.5, p=0.09) and a reduction in death or poor outcome of 1.2% (‐4.2 to 6.6, p=0.7). In the PEG versus nasogastric tube trial, 321 patients were enrolled by 47 hospitals in 11 countries.

We aimed to establish whether routine oral nutritional supplements improve outcome after stroke. METHODS: The FOOD trials are a family of three pragmatic, multicentre, randomised controlled trials. We measured the outcomes of stroke patients who could swallow and who were randomly allocated normal hospital diet or normal hospital diet plus oral nutritional supplements until hospital discharge. The primary outcome was death or poor outcome (modified Rankin scale [MRS] grade 3‐5), 6 months after enrollment, measured unaware of treatment allocation. Analysis was by intention to treat. FINDINGS: Between Nov 1, 1996, and July 31, 2003, 4023 patients were enrolled by 125 hospitals in 15 countries. Only 314 (8%) patients were judged to be undernourished at baseline. Vital status and MRS at the end of the trial were known for 4012 and 4004 patients, respectively.

METHODS: Thirty‐one elderly patients (12 males and 19 females; median age = 74 [range,65‐90] y old) with ischemic stroke were randomized to receive early nasogastric feeding (35 kcal/kg/d and 1.2 g of protein/kg/d) with either a formula containing polymeric [corrected] casein (casein group, n =16) or another isocaloric and isonitrogenous formula containing hydrolyzed whey protein (WP group, n = 15) for 5 d. The primary endpoints of the study were the changes in the serum levels of glutathione peroxidase, C‐reactive protein (CRP), and interleukin 6 (IL‐6). RESULTS: Twenty‐five patients completed the study (10 in the WP group and 15 in the casein group). Mortality was similar between groups (33%; P = 1.00) and was associated with higher serum IL‐6 (73.7 ± 24.7 versus 16.6 ± 2.4 pg/dL; P = 0.04) and CRP (82.0 ± 35.6 versus 48.3 ± 14.5 mg/L; P = 0.02) levels. Albumin levels dropped from the first to the fifth feeding day only in the casein group (P < 0.01). Serum IL‐6 decreased (62.7 ± 47.2 to 20.6 ± 10.3 pg/dL; P = 0.02) and glutathione increased (32.2 ± 2.1 to 39.9 ± 6.8 U/G Hb; P = 0.03) only in the WP group. Serum IL‐6 was lower (P = 0.03) and glutathione was higher (P = 0.03) in whey protein‐fed patients than in the casein group.

Baseline demographic data, GCS, Canadian neurological score and APACHE II score; daily ventilatory parameters, Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) Score, blood parameters, ICU mortality and duration of stay, length of mechanical ventilation, complications, and duration of hospital stay and outcome at discharge were compared. Results: The two groups were comparable in terms of baseline characteristics. Patients in indirect calorimetry group had significantly more resting energy requirement and less maximum negative energy balance. The SOFA score on days 5, 7 and 9 were higher in weight‐based regimen group. Rest of the variables were similar between the groups.

It has been documented that 1 microbiota dysbiosis may have certain impact on post inflammation in ischemic stroke and the outcome of brain injury, 2 exercise training may lead to compositional and functional changes in human gut microbiota. This study was designed to verify how the EEN influences fecal microbiota in ischemic stroke rehabilitation. Methods: Eligible patients were enrolled and were randomly assigned into the control group and the EEN group. All the patients received stroke‐specified rehabilitation intervention including physical training, occupational training and swallow training. Patients in the control group were treated with daily diet while patients in the EEN group received EEN. Follow‐up evaluation was performed at baseline, two weeks and four weeks after intervention. Comprehensive Illumina Mise microarray was applied to analysis microbiota construction of clinical samples. HPLC was used to detect short chain fatty acid. Plasma inflammatory cytokines were tested with Elisa. Results: Twenty‐two patients with sub‐acute ischemic stroke participated this study. It was found that the fecal microbiota in the 22 patients mainly composed by 4 taxonomic clusters. The diversity and abundance of flora was increased in the EEN group. No significant result was detected in one week while the EEN group showed significant better results of Modified Rankin Scale Score, activity of daily living and the function of swallow as compared to the control group. Specifically, the level of plasma short chain fatty acid was significantly higher in the EEN group than that of the control group. The change of microbiota metabolites alteration induced by EEN was consistent with the variation of SCFA‐producing bacteria gene and taxonomic group. Conclusion: EEN induced immune response and metabolites regulation via reconstruction of gut microbiota, and in turn improved ischemic stroke through gut‐microbiota‐ brain axis.","33",,"219","Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL)",,"EMBASE 626846500",,,,"Journal article; Conference proceeding","*intestine flora; *stroke rehabilitation; Adult; Brain injury; Clinical article; Conference abstract; Controlled study; DNA microarray; Daily life activity; Diet; Enzyme linked immunosorbent assay; Feces microflora; Female; Follow up; Human; Human tissue; Immune response; Inflammation; Male; Nonhuman; Plasma; Randomized controlled trial; Rankin scale; Training","10.1111/jgh.14482","https://www.cochranelibrary.com/central/doi/10.1002/central/CN-01914759/full",

This study evaluated the feasibility and potential value of protein supplementation with aerobic exercise among stroke survivors. METHODS: This double‐blinded randomized controlled pilot study included 20 ambulatory persons with chronic (>6 months) stroke randomly assigned to either the protein (PRO) or carbohydrate (CHO) group. All participants received three 40‐min cycling ergometric training sessions a week for 8 weeks. Training intensity at 60%‐80% heart rate reserve was determined using cardiopulmonary exercise pretests. Immediately before and after each session, the PRO group received a 20‐g protein‐rich supplement, and the CHO group received a 20‐g calorie‐matched carbohydrate‐rich supplement. Outcomes included changes in body composition, cardiopulmonary capacity, and clinical functional performance. RESULTS: Those completing the protocol (n = 18) received 18‐24 cycling training sessions, achieving target training intensity without major adverse effects. Of the two groups, the PRO group tended to obtain greater aerobic capacity (effect size [ES]>0.5 in every cardiopulmonary index), greater improvements in functional performance (0.25 < ES < 1.00 in various clinical tests), and greater total lean mass versus total fat mass (ES = 0.52). CONCLUSIONS: Protein supplementation with aerobic exercise training tends to improve body composition, cardiopulmonary fitness, and function among persons with stroke. This study protocol is feasible, and future trials with larger sample sizes could confirm these results.

Micronutrients contributing to the antioxidant (AOX) defense exhibit low plasma levels during critical illness. The aim of this study was to investigate the impact of early AOX micronutrients on clinical outcome in intensive care unit (ICU) patients with conditions characterized by oxidative stress. METHODS: We conducted a prospective, randomized, double‐blind, placebo‐controlled, single‐center trial in patients admitted to a university hospital ICU with organ failure after complicated cardiac surgery, major trauma, or subarachnoid hemorrhage. Stratification by diagnosis was performed before randomization. The intervention was intravenous supplements for 5 days (selenium 270 microg, zinc 30 mg, vitamin C 1.1 g, and vitamin B1 100 mg) with a double‐loading dose on days 1 and 2 or placebo. RESULTS: Two hundred patients were included (102 AOX and 98 placebo). While age and gender did not differ, brain injury was more severe in the AOX trauma group (P = 0.019). Organ function endpoints did not differ: incidence of acute kidney failure and sequential organ failure assessment score decrease were similar (‐3.2 +/‐ 3.2 versus ‐4.2 +/‐ 2.3 over the course of 5 days). Plasma concentrations of selenium, zinc, and glutathione peroxidase, low on admission, increased significantly to within normal values in the AOX group. C‐reactive protein decreased faster in the AOX group (P = 0.039). Infectious complications did not differ. Length of hospital stay did not differ (16.5 versus 20 days), being shorter only in surviving AOX trauma patients (‐10 days; P = 0.045). CONCLUSION: The AOX intervention did not reduce early organ dysfunction but significantly reduced the inflammatory response in cardiac surgery and trauma patients, which may prove beneficial in conditions with an intense inflammation.

Methods: SAH subjects with a Hunt Hess (HH) grade > 1,modified Fisher score > 1 and BMI < 40 kg/m2 were randomly assigned to SOC or NMES + HPRO. NMES was delivered to bilateral quadricep muscles daily during two 30‐min sessions along with HPRO (goal:1.8 g/kg/day) between post‐bleed day (PBD) 0 and 14. Primary endpoint was atrophy in the quadricep muscle as measured by the percentage difference in the cross‐sectional area from baseline to PBD14 on CT scan. All subjects underwent serial assessments of physical (short performance physical battery, SPPB) cognitive (Montreal Cognitive Assessment Scale, MoCA) and global functional recovery (modified Rankin Scale, mRS) at PBD 14, 42, and 90.

We studied whether neuromuscular electrical stimulation(NMES) and high protein supplementation(HPRO) in the first two weeks after SAH could preserve neuromotor and cognitive function as compared to standard of care(SOC) for nutrition and mobilization. Methods SAH subjects with a Hunt Hess(HH) grade>1, modified Fisher score>l and BMI<40 kg/m2 were randomly assigned to SOC or NMES+HPRO. NMES was delivered to bilateral quadriceps and gastrocnemius muscles daily during two 30 minute sessions along with HPRO(goal:1.8 g/kg/day) between post bleed day(PBD) 0 and 14. Primary endpoint was atrophy in the quadriceps muscle as measured by the percentage difference in the cross sectional area from baseline to PBD14 on CT scan. All subjects underwent serial assessments of physical(short performance physical battery,SPPB) cognitive(Montreal Cognitive Assessment Scale,MoCA) and global functional recovery(modified Rankin Scale,mRS) at PBD 14, 42, and 90. Results Twenty‐five subjects(SOC=13,NMES+HPRO=12) were enrolled between December 2017 and January 2019 with no between group differences in baseline characteristics(58 years old, 68% women, 50% HH>3). Median duration of interventions was 12 days(range 9‐14) completing 98% of NMES sessions and 83% of goal protein intake. No difference in caloric intake between groups, but HPRO+NMES group received more protein(1.5 +/‐0.5 g/kg/d v 0.9+/‐0.4 g/kg/d,P<0.01). Muscle atrophy at PBD 14 was less in NMES+HPRO group(2.8+/‐2.9% vs 6.7+/‐3.2% ,P=0.01). On univariate analysis, higher atrophy was correlated with lower daily protein intake (r=‐0.59,P=0.002); and worse 3 month MoCA (r=‐0.39, P=0.06),SPPB(r=‐0.31,P=0.1) and mRS(r=0.46,P=0.03). NMES+HPRO subjects performed better on SPPB(P=0.03), were observed to have a lower mRS(P=0.01) and obtained a higher MoCA(P=0.1) than SOC at PBD 90. Conclusions NMES+HPRO may reduce acute muscle wasting in lower extremities with a lasting benefit on recovery after SAH. To better understand whether NMES and/or HPRO are responsible for observed benefits, a larger, multicenter study is underway.","31","1","S12","Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL)",,"EMBASE 631884677",,,,"Journal article; Conference proceeding","*neuromuscular electrical stimulation; *remission; *subarachnoid hemorrhage; Adult; Body mass; Caloric intake; Clinical article; Cognition; Conference abstract; Controlled study; Female; Gastrocnemius muscle; Health care quality; Human; Male; Middle aged; Montreal cognitive assessment; Motoneuron; Multicenter study; Muscle atrophy; Protein intake; Quadriceps femoris muscle; Randomized controlled trial; Rankin scale; Univariate analysis; X‐ray computed tomography","10.1007/s12028-019-00857-7","https://www.cochranelibrary.com/central/doi/10.1002/central/CN-02130252/full","Stroke"

Forty‐two dysphagic stroke patients (27 men; 71±9 years) underwent bio‐humoral measurements, neuro‐functional tests, including Functional Independence Measure (FIM) and Dysphagia Outcome and Severity Scale (DOSS), and were randomized to receive EAAs 8 g/d (EAA group) or isocaloric maltodextrin (placebo group). At discharge all measurements were repeated 38±1 days after randomization. At admission, total white cell (TWC), neutrophil (N), and lymphocyte (Lymph) counts were normal and the N/Lymph ratio was higher than normal values (<3.0). At discharge, both TWC and N decreased while Lymph increased significantly. As a result, the N/Lymph ratio significantly decreased (P <0.001) returning to normal levels. Absolute Lymph counts and Lymph % TWC correlated positively with DOSS (r = +0.235, P = 0.04 and r = +0.224, P = 0.05, respectively), negatively with C‐reactive protein natural logarithm (ln CRP) (P = 0.02 and P = 0.0001, respectively), which is an inflammation marker. N correlated positively with ln CRP (P = 0.001) and had a slight negative association with FIM (P = 0.07). The N/Lymph ratio was inversely related to FIM (r = ‐0.262, P = 0.02) and DOSS (r = ‐0.279, P = 0.01). Finally, FIM correlated with DOSS (r = +0.35, P = 0.05). For the regression analysis, the overtime changes of Lymph % TWC correlated significantly with DOSS (P = 0.01). There was a positive correlation between Lymph % TWC and DOSS for the entire stroke population (P = 0.015). While this correlation was not important for the placebo group (P = 0.27), it was significant in the EAA subgroup (P = 0.018). In the sub‐acute stroke stage, there may be slight alterations of peripheral blood immune cells. Lymph cells are associated with improved neuro‐function tests with evidence that this association is enhanced by supplementing EAAs.","28","4","576‐583","Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL)","PUBMED 26437899","EMBASE 606755256",,,,"Journal article","*adaptive immunity; *brain ischemia /rehabilitation; *cerebrovascular accident /rehabilitation; *dysphagia; Acute phase response; Adaptive Immunity; Aged; Amino Acids, Essential [*administration & dosage]; Article; Body weight; Brain Ischemia [*immunology, physiopathology]; Clinical article; Controlled study; C‐Reactive Protein [analysis]; Deglutition [*physiology]; Disease severity assessment; Dysphagia Outcome and Severity Scale; Female; Function test; Functional Independence Measure; Glucose blood level; Hospital discharge; Human; Humans; Immunocompetent cell; Leukocyte Count; Lymphocyte; Male; Middle Aged; Neurologic examination; Occupational therapy; Physical capacity; Physical disability; Priority journal; Randomized controlled trial; Speech therapy; Stroke [*immunology, physiopathology]; Stroke patient; Swallowing","10.1177/0394632015608249","https://www.cochranelibrary.com/central/doi/10.1002/central/CN-01105492/full",

We investigated whether hypercatabolic activity occurred in unaffected arm muscle and whether supplemented essential amino acids (EAAs) could limit muscle hypercatabolism (MH). Thirty‐eight dysphagic subacute stroke subjects (<3 months after acute event) (29 males+9 females; 69.7±11.4 yrs) were enrolled and randomized to receive 8 g/day EAAs (n=19; EAA group) or isocaloric placebo (maltodextrin; n=19, Plac group). Before randomization, all patients had their arterial (A) and venous (V) amino acids measured and muscle (A‐V) differences calculated in the unaffected arm. Eight matched and healthy subjects served as controls. When compared to healthy controls, the entire stroke population showed significant muscle release (=negative value A‐V) of the amino acid phenylalanine (phenyl‐) indicating a prevalence of MH. Moreover, randomized EAA and Plac groups had similar rates of MH. After 38 days from the start of the protocol, the EAA group but not the Plac group had MH converted to balanced protein turnover or anabolic activity. We concluded that muscle protein metabolism of the unaffected arm of dysphagic subacute stroke individuals could be characterized by MH which can be corrected by supplemented EAAs.","2014",,"964365","Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL)","PUBMED 25431770","EMBASE 600564843",,,,"Journal article","*arm muscle; *cerebrovascular accident/rh [Rehabilitation]; *diet supplementation; *dysphagia; *essential amino acid/ct [Clinical Trial]; *essential amino acid/dt [Drug Therapy]; *muscle disease/dt [Drug Therapy]; *protein degradation; 3 methylhistidine/ct [Clinical Trial]; 3 methylhistidine/dt [Drug Therapy]; Acute phase response; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Alanine/ct [Clinical Trial]; Alanine/dt [Drug Therapy]; Amino Acids, Essential [*administration & dosage, adverse effects]; Amino acid blood level; Arginine/ct [Clinical Trial]; Arginine/dt [Drug Therapy]; Arm [*physiopathology]; Article; Asparagine/ct [Clinical Trial]; Asparagine/dt [Drug Therapy]; Aspartic acid/ct [Clinical Trial]; Aspartic acid/dt [Drug Therapy]; C reactive protein/ec [Endogenous Compound]; Citrulline/ct [Clinical Trial]; Citrulline/dt [Drug Therapy]; Clinical article; Clinical study; Computer assisted tomography; Controlled study; Cysteine/ct [Clinical Trial]; Cysteine/dt [Drug Therapy]; Dietary Supplements; Dietary intake; Double blind procedure; Female; Functional status; Glutamic acid/ct [Clinical Trial]; Glutamic acid/dt [Drug Therapy]; Glutamine/ct [Clinical Trial]; Glutamine/dt [Drug Therapy]; Glycine/ct [Clinical Trial]; Glycine/dt [Drug Therapy]; Histidine/ct [Clinical Trial]; Histidine/dt [Drug Therapy]; Hospital admission; Hospital discharge; Human; Humans; Insulin [metabolism]; Interleukin 6/ec [Endogenous Compound]; Isoleucine/ct [Clinical Trial]; Isoleucine/dt [Drug Therapy]; Lactate blood level; Lactic acid/ec [Endogenous Compound]; Leucine/ct [Clinical Trial]; Leucine/dt [Drug Therapy]; Lysine/ct [Clinical Trial]; Lysine/dt [Drug Therapy]; Male; Maltodextrin; Metabolism [drug effects]; Methionine/ct [Clinical Trial]; Methionine/dt [Drug Therapy]; Middle Aged; Muscle relaxation; Muscle, Skeletal [drug effects, metabolism, pathology]; Nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; Phenylalanine/ct [Clinical Trial]; Phenylalanine/dt [Drug Therapy]; Protein blood level; Protein synthesis; Randomized controlled trial; Serine/ct [Clinical Trial]; Serine/dt [Drug Therapy]; Stroke [diet therapy, *metabolism, pathology]; Stroke patient; Taurine/ct [Clinical Trial]; Taurine/dt [Drug Therapy]; Threonine/ct [Clinical Trial]; Threonine/dt [Drug Therapy]; Tryptophan/ct [Clinical Trial]; Tryptophan/dt [Drug Therapy]; Tyrosine/ct [Clinical Trial]; Tyrosine/dt [Drug Therapy]; Valine/ct [Clinical Trial]; Valine/dt [Drug Therapy]","10.1155/2014/964365","https://www.cochranelibrary.com/central/doi/10.1002/central/CN-01089858/full","Complementary Medicine"
