The literature provides promising results on the beneficial effect of exercise and vitamin supplementation on cognitive function both in cognitively healthy as well as in the demented elderly. METHODS/DESIGN: The design is a two‐by‐two factorial randomised controlled trial. The study population consists of independently living elderly, between 70 and 80 years old, with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). In the RCT the effect of two interventions, a walking program and vitamin supplementation, is examined. The walking program (WP) is a group‐based program aimed at improving cardiovascular endurance; frequency two lessons a week; lesson duration one hour; program duration one year. Non‐walking groups receive a placebo activity program (PAP) (i.e. low intensive non‐aerobic group exercises, like stretching) with the same frequency, lesson and program duration. Vitamin supplementation consists of a single daily vitamin supplement containing 50 mg B6, 5 mg folic acid and 0,4 mg B12 for one year. Subjects not receiving vitamin supplements are daily taking an identically looking placebo pill, also for a year. Participants are randomised to four groups 1) WP and vitamin supplements; 2) WP and placebo supplements; 3) PAP and vitamin supplements; 4) PAP and placebo supplements. Primary outcome measures are measures of cognitive function. Secondary outcomes include psychosocial wellbeing, physical activity, cardiovascular endurance and blood vitamin levels. DISCUSSION: No large intervention study has been conducted yet on the effect of physical activity and vitamin supplementation in a population‐based sample of adults with MCI. The objective of the present article is to describe the design of a randomised controlled trial examining the effect of a walking program and vitamin B supplementation on the rate of cognitive decline in older adults with MCI.","5",,"18","Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL)","PUBMED 16375760",,"","","","Journal article","Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Clinical Protocols; Cognition Disorders [*psychology, *therapy]; Combined Modality Therapy; Double‐Blind Method; Exercise Therapy; Humans; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic; Severity of Illness Index; Vitamin B Complex [*therapeutic use]; Walking","10.1186/1471-2318-5-18","https://www.cochranelibrary.com/central/doi/10.1002/central/CN-00561835/full","Complementary Medicine; Dementia and Cognitive Improvement"

A randomised controlled trial","British journal of sports medicine","2008","OBJECTIVE: To examine the effects of aerobic exercise or vitamin B supplementation on cognitive function in older adults with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). DESIGN: Randomised placebo‐controlled trial. SETTING: General community. PARTICIPANTS: Community‐dwelling adults aged 70‐80 with MCI. Interventions : The 152 participants were randomly assigned to two INTERVENTIONS: (1) a twice‐weekly, group‐based, moderate‐intensity walking programme (WP, n = 77) or a low‐intensity placebo activity programme (n = 75) for one year; and (2) daily vitamin pill containing 5 mg folic acid, 0.4 mg vitamin B‐12, 50 mg vitamin B‐6 (FA/B12/B6, n = 78) or placebo pill (n = 74) for one year. OUTCOME MEASURES: Cognitive function, measured with neuropsychological tests at baseline and after six and 12 months. RESULTS: Median session attendance at the exercise programmes (25th‐75th percentile) was 63% (2%‐81%) and median compliance with taking pills (25th‐75th percentile) was 100% (99%‐100%). Gender was an effect modifier. Intention‐to‐treat analysis revealed no main intervention effect for either intervention. In women in the WP, attention (Stroop combination task) improved by 0.3 seconds (p = 0.04) and memory (auditory verbal learning test) by 0.04 words (p = 0.06) with each percentage increase in session attendance. In men attending at least 75% of the sessions, the WP improved memory (beta 1.5 (95% CI: 0.1 to 3.0) words). CONCLUSION: The walking programme and/or FA/B12/B6 supplementation were not effective in improving cognition within one year. The walking programme, however, was efficacious in improving memory in men and memory and attention in women with better adherence.

METHODS: In a double‐blind study, we evaluated subjects with the amnestic subtype of mild cognitive impairment. Subjects were randomly assigned to receive 2000 IU of vitamin E daily, 10 mg of donepezil daily, or placebo for three years. The primary outcome was clinically possible or probable Alzheimer's disease; secondary outcomes were cognition and function. RESULTS: A total of 769 subjects were enrolled, and possible or probable Alzheimer's disease developed in 212. The overall rate of progression from mild cognitive impairment to Alzheimer's disease was 16 percent per year. As compared with the placebo group, there were no significant differences in the probability of progression to Alzheimer's disease in the vitamin E group (hazard ratio, 1.02; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.74 to 1.41; P=0.91) or the donepezil group (hazard ratio, 0.80; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.57 to 1.13; P=0.42) during the three years of treatment. Prespecified analyses of the treatment effects at 6‐month intervals showed that as compared with the placebo group, the donepezil group had a reduced likelihood of progression to Alzheimer's disease during the first 12 months of the study (P=0.04), a finding supported by the secondary outcome measures. Among carriers of one or more apolipoprotein E epsilon4 alleles, the benefit of donepezil was evident throughout the three‐year follow‐up. There were no significant differences in the rate of progression to Alzheimer's disease between the vitamin E and placebo groups at any point, either among all patients or among apolipoprotein E epsilon4 carriers. CONCLUSIONS: Vitamin E had no benefit in patients with mild cognitive impairment. Although donepezil therapy was associated with a lower rate of progression to Alzheimer's disease during the first 12 months of treatment, the rate of progression to Alzheimer's disease after three years was not lower among patients treated with donepezil than among those given placebo.","352","23","2379‐2388","Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL)","PUBMED 15829527","EMBASE 40958434",,,,"Journal article","Alzheimer Disease [genetics, *prevention & control]; Apolipoprotein E4; Apolipoproteins E [genetics]; Cholinesterase Inhibitors [adverse effects, *therapeutic use]; Cognition Disorders [*drug therapy]; Disease Progression; Donepezil; Double‐Blind Method; Humans; Indans [adverse effects, *therapeutic use]; Nootropic Agents [adverse effects, therapeutic use]; Piperidines [adverse effects, *therapeutic use]; Proportional Hazards Models; Treatment Failure; Vitamin E [adverse effects, *therapeutic use]","10.1056/NEJMoa050151","https://www.cochranelibrary.com/central/doi/10.1002/central/CN-00515264/full","Dementia and Cognitive Improvement"

METHODS: We evaluated 539 participants with aMCI from the Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study clinical drug trial of donepezil, vitamin E, or placebo. During the study period of 36 months, 212 aMCI participants progressed to AD. Using progression from aMCI to AD within 36 months as the dependent variable, a generalized linear model was fit to the data using the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator. Independent variables included in this analysis were age, sex, education, APOE‐e4 (APOE4) status, family history of dementia, Mini‐Mental State Examination score, Digits Backwards (Wechsler Memory Scale), Maze Time and Errors, Number Cancellation, Delayed Recall of Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale Word List, New York University Paragraph Recall Test (Immediate and Delayed), Boston Naming Test, Category Fluency, Clock Drawing Test, and the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale‐Cognitive subscale (ADAS‐cog). RESULTS: The model that best predicted progression from aMCI to AD over 36 months included APOE4 status, the Symbol Digit Modalities Test, Delayed 10‐Word List Recall, New York University Paragraph Recall Test (Delayed), and the ADAS‐cog total score. When APOE4 was removed from the analysis the resulting model had a similar estimated predictive accuracy as the full model.

Cognitive function was assessed before and after 24 wk of treatment with the use of an extensive neuropsychologic test battery that included the domains of attention, construction, sensomotor speed, memory, and executive function. RESULTS: Vitamin B‐12 status did not change significantly after treatment in the placebo group; however, oral vitamin B‐12 supplementation corrected mild vitamin B‐12 deficiency. Vitamin B‐12 + folic acid supplementation increased red blood cell folate concentrations and decreased tHcy concentrations by 36%. Improvement in memory function was greater in the placebo group than in the group who received vitamin B‐12 alone (P = 0.0036). Neither supplementation with vitamin B‐12 alone nor that in combination with folic acid was accompanied by any improvement in other cognitive domains. CONCLUSION: Oral supplementation with vitamin B‐12 alone or in combination with folic acid for 24 wk does not improve cognitive function.","84","2","361‐370","Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL)","PUBMED 16895884","EMBASE 44699146",,,,"Journal article","*cognition; *cyanocobalamin deficiency/dt [Drug Therapy]; *cyanocobalamin/cb [Drug Combination]; *cyanocobalamin/cm [Drug Comparison]; *cyanocobalamin/ct [Clinical Trial]; *cyanocobalamin/do [Drug Dose]; *cyanocobalamin/dt [Drug Therapy]; *cyanocobalamin/po [Oral Drug Administration]; *folic acid/cb [Drug Combination]; *folic acid/cm [Drug Comparison]; *folic acid/ct [Clinical Trial]; *folic acid/do [Drug Dose]; *folic acid/dt [Drug Therapy]; *folic acid/po [Oral Drug Administration]; Administration, Oral; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Amino acid blood level; Article; Attention; Clinical trial; Cognition Disorders [etiology, *prevention & control]; Cognition [*drug effects, physiology]; Controlled clinical trial; Controlled study; Dietary Supplements; Dietary intake; Disease severity; Dose response; Double blind procedure; Double‐Blind Method; Drug Therapy, Combination; Female; Folic Acid [*pharmacology, therapeutic use]; Folic acid blood level; Homocysteine [blood]; Homocysteine/ec [Endogenous Compound]; Human; Humans; Major clinical study; Male; Memory; Memory [drug effects, physiology]; Methylmalonic Acid [blood]; Methylmalonic acid/ec [Endogenous Compound]; Neuropsychological test; Nutritional assessment; Placebo; Psychomotor Performance [drug effects]; Randomized controlled trial; Sensorimotor function; Transcobalamin/ec [Endogenous Compound]; Transcobalamins [analysis, metabolism]; Treatment outcome; Vitamin B 12 Deficiency [blood, complications, *drug therapy]; Vitamin B 12 [*pharmacology, therapeutic use]; Vitamin blood level; Vitamin supplementation","10.1093/ajcn/84.1.361","https://www.cochranelibrary.com/central/doi/10.1002/central/CN-00567191/full","Complementary Medicine; Dementia and Cognitive Improvement"

However, the associations between the one‐carbon metabolites choline, betaine, methionine and dimethylglycine with cognition in elderly are unclear. We therefore examined the associations of these metabolites with cognition in a double‐blind, placebo‐controlled trial. Individuals (n 195) were randomized to receive daily oral capsules with either 1000 microg cobalamin (vitamin B12), or 1000 microg cobalamin plus 400 microg folic acid, or placebo for 24 weeks. Concentrations of homocysteine, methionine, choline, betaine and dimethylglycine were assessed before and after 12 and 24 weeks of treatment. Cognitive function, including domains of attention, construction, sensomotor speed, memory and executive function, was assessed before and after 24 weeks of treatment. At baseline, elevated plasma homocysteine was associated with lower performance of attention, construction, sensomotor speed and executive function. In addition, betaine was positively associated with better performance of construction, sensomotor speed and executive function, whereas elevated concentrations of methionine were positively associated with sensomotor speed. Daily combined supplementation with cobalamin plus folic acid decreased total homocysteine concentrations by 36%, and increased betaine concentrations by 38%. Participants with the largest increases in betaine concentrations showed a borderline significant (P = 0.07) higher memory performance compared to those without it. Although this trial observed associations of homocysteine and betaine with cognitive domains prior to supplementation, decreased concentrations of homocysteine were not related to improved cognitive performance. There was a tendency of participants with the largest increases in betaine concentrations to show the greatest improvement in memory function.","98","5","960‐968","Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL)","PUBMED 17537289",,,,,"Journal article","Aged; Attention [drug effects]; Betaine [*blood]; Choline [blood]; Cognition [*drug effects, physiology]; Double‐Blind Method; Drug Combinations; Female; Folic Acid [pharmacology]; Homocysteine [*blood]; Humans; Male; Memory [drug effects]; Neuropsychological Tests; Psychomotor Performance [drug effects]; Sarcosine [analogs & derivatives, blood]; Vitamin B 12 [*pharmacology]; Vitamin B Complex [pharmacology]","10.1017/S0007114507750912","https://www.cochranelibrary.com/central/doi/10.1002/central/CN-00618153/full",

In the first report on the VITACOG trial, we showed that homocysteine‐lowering treatment with B vitamins slows the rate of brain atrophy in mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Here we report the effect of B vitamins on cognitive and clinical decline (secondary outcomes) in the same study. METHODS: This was a double‐blind, single‐centre study, which included participants with MCI, aged ≥ 70 y, randomly assigned to receive a daily dose of 0.8 mg folic acid, 0.5 mg vitamin B(12) and 20 mg vitamin B(6) (133 participants) or placebo (133 participants) for 2 y. Changes in cognitive or clinical function were analysed by generalized linear models or mixed‐effects models. RESULTS: The mean plasma total homocysteine was 30% lower in those treated with B vitamins relative to placebo. B vitamins stabilized executive function (CLOX) relative to placebo (P = 0.015). There was significant benefit of B‐vitamin treatment among participants with baseline homocysteine above the median (11.3 µmol/L) in global cognition (Mini Mental State Examination, P < 0.001), episodic memory (Hopkins Verbal Learning Test‐delayed recall, P = 0.001) and semantic memory (category fluency, P = 0.037). Clinical benefit occurred in the B‐vitamin group for those in the upper quartile of homocysteine at baseline in global clinical dementia rating score (P = 0.02) and IQCODE score (P = 0.01). CONCLUSION: In this small intervention trial, B vitamins appear to slow cognitive and clinical decline in people with MCI, in particular in those with elevated homocysteine. Further trials are needed to see if this treatment will slow or prevent conversion from MCI to dementia.","27","6","592‐600","Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL)","PUBMED 21780182",,,,,"Journal article","Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Cognition Disorders [blood, *drug therapy, physiopathology]; Cognition [drug effects]; Double‐Blind Method; Executive Function [drug effects]; Female; Folic Acid [blood, therapeutic use]; Homocysteine [*blood]; Humans; Linear Models; Male; Memory [drug effects]; Vitamin B 12 [blood, therapeutic use]; Vitamin B 6 [blood, therapeutic use]; Vitamin B Complex [blood, *therapeutic use]","10.1002/gps.2758","https://www.cochranelibrary.com/central/doi/10.1002/central/CN-00882645/full","Complementary Medicine"

One approach is to modify nongenetic risk factors, for instance by lowering elevated plasma homocysteine using B vitamins. In an initial, randomized controlled study on elderly subjects with increased dementia risk (mild cognitive impairment according to 2004 Petersen criteria), we showed that high‐dose B‐vitamin treatment (folic acid 0.8 mg, vitamin B6 20 mg, vitamin B12 0.5 mg) slowed shrinkage of the whole brain volume over 2 y. Here, we go further by demonstrating that B‐vitamin treatment reduces, by as much as seven fold, the cerebral atrophy in those gray matter (GM) regions specifically vulnerable to the AD process, including the medial temporal lobe. In the placebo group, higher homocysteine levels at baseline are associated with faster GM atrophy, but this deleterious effect is largely prevented by B‐vitamin treatment. We additionally show that the beneficial effect of B vitamins is confined to participants with high homocysteine (above the median, 11 µmol/L) and that, in these participants, a causal Bayesian network analysis indicates the following chain of events: B vitamins lower homocysteine, which directly leads to a decrease in GM atrophy, thereby slowing cognitive decline. Our results show that B‐vitamin supplementation can slow the atrophy of specific brain regions that are a key component of the AD process and that are associated with cognitive decline. Further B‐vitamin supplementation trials focusing on elderly subjets with high homocysteine levels are warranted to see if progression to dementia can be prevented.","110","23","9523‐9528","Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL)","PUBMED 23690582","EMBASE 369067931",,,,"Journal article","Alzheimer Disease [*complications]; Bayes Theorem; England; Hippocampus [drug effects, pathology]; Homocysteine [*blood]; Humans; Image Processing, Computer‐Assisted; Linear Models; Longitudinal Studies; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Nerve Degeneration [etiology, pathology, *prevention & control]; Temporal Lobe [drug effects, pathology]; Vitamin B Complex [pharmacology, *therapeutic use]","10.1073/pnas.1301816110","https://www.cochranelibrary.com/central/doi/10.1002/central/CN-00863129/full","Dementia and Cognitive Improvement"

Homocysteine is a risk factor for brain atrophy, cognitive impairment and dementia. Plasma concentrations of homocysteine can be lowered by dietary administration of B vitamins. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether supplementation with B vitamins that lower levels of plasma total homocysteine can slow the rate of brain atrophy in subjects with mild cognitive impairment in a randomised controlled trial (VITACOG, ISRCTN 94410159). METHODS AND FINDINGS: Single‐center, randomized, double‐blind controlled trial of high‐dose folic acid, vitamins B(6) and B(12) in 271 individuals (of 646 screened) over 70 y old with mild cognitive impairment. A subset (187) volunteered to have cranial MRI scans at the start and finish of the study. Participants were randomly assigned to two groups of equal size, one treated with folic acid (0.8 mg/d), vitamin B(12) (0.5 mg/d) and vitamin B(6) (20 mg/d), the other with placebo; treatment was for 24 months. The main outcome measure was the change in the rate of atrophy of the whole brain assessed by serial volumetric MRI scans. RESULTS: A total of 168 participants (85 in active treatment group; 83 receiving placebo) completed the MRI section of the trial. The mean rate of brain atrophy per year was 0.76% [95% CI, 0.63‐0.90] in the active treatment group and 1.08% [0.94‐1.22] in the placebo group (P =  0.001). The treatment response was related to baseline homocysteine levels: the rate of atrophy in participants with homocysteine >13 µmol/L was 53% lower in the active treatment group (P =  0.001). A greater rate of atrophy was associated with a lower final cognitive test scores. There was no difference in serious adverse events according to treatment category. CONCLUSIONS AND SIGNIFICANCE: The accelerated rate of brain atrophy in elderly with mild cognitive impairment can be slowed by treatment with homocysteine‐lowering B vitamins. Sixteen percent of those over 70 y old have mild cognitive impairment and half of these develop Alzheimer's disease. Since accelerated brain atrophy is a characteristic of subjects with mild cognitive impairment who convert to Alzheimer's disease, trials are needed to see if the same treatment will delay the development of Alzheimer's disease.
